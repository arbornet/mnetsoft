Dear {$name},

    This is the 'newuser' program on grex.org, where you
recently created an account.  I'm just writing to let you
know that your account has been created and is ready to
be logged into.  Your login information is as follows:

        login:     {$login}
        password:  {$password}

    You may login via SSH using a client of your choice.
If you are using Mac OS X or some variant of Unix (such
as Linux), an SSH client is very likely already installed
on your computer; just open a Terminal window or xterm and
type,

	ssh {$login}@grex.org

    If you are using Microsoft Windows, we recommend using
the 'PuTTY' client (use your favorite search engine to
find a download link near you).

    If, for whatever reason, you cannot use SSH, you may
also login using telnet, but this has been deprecated on
Grex and isn't likely to be supported for much longer.

    We hope you enjoy using our system and the services we
offer.  Whether your interest is in our discussion forums,
real time chat, or just learning about Unix and programming,
we hope you will find us a compelling offering and stay
with us for some time.

    If there are any questions or concerns, feel free to
get in touch with the Grex staff by sendmail email to
help\@grex.org, or on the web at http://grex.org/.  Happy
hacking on behalf of the Grex staff,

        - The Newuser Program
