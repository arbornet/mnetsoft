The next questions two are mandatory: you must answer them in order
to create an account on Grex.  You will be asked for your name and
your email address.

We ask that you enter your real name, if you can; this will better
identify you to other users on the system and help us cut down on
abuse (and validate your account!).

You MUST enter a valid email address, since your password will be
emailed there.  If you do not, you will never get your password and
you will not be able to login.
