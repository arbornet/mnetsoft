Welcome to Grex, a service of Cyberspace Communications, Inc.

   Note: Grex does not allow bots of ANY kind--they will not work
         here.  IRC only works for verified users.  Bringing over
         your own copies WILL NOT WORK.  Do not copy IRC/bots to
         Grex.  EGGDROP WILL NOT WORK HERE.  BOUNCERS WILL NOT WORK
         HERE.

Grex is a virtualized x86 system running BSD and is maintained by
an all-volunteer staff.

You may be wondering what kind of place Grex is.  To help explain
that, here is the Grex Declaration of Principles:

{pause}#
{include("principles")}#

{include("limits")}#

Right then, let's get started.

You will be asked a series of questions and have an account created
for you on this computer.  After that is finished, you will have a
public login name of your chosing that will uniquely identify you
to the system.  A (secret) password will be randomly generated and
emailed to you at an address you provide, allowing you to login.
In future sessions, you will login using that login name, rather
than 'newuser.'

You will have a chance to revise anything you write when answering
the following questions, so don't worry if you make a typing mistake
or something like that.

Almost anywhere on the system where you are asked to type a variable
number of lines, you will end your input by typing a period ('.')
character on a line by itself.  That is, hit RETURN or ENTER, type
a period by itself, and hit RETURN or ENTER again.
