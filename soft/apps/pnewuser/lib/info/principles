This system is intended to foster community education and the
    mental and intellectual enrichment of its users through
    the peaceable interchange of ideas.
The members of this system hope to attract a large, diverse, and
    mature audience and thereby to contribute to a better-informed
    citizenry.
Governance of the system is based on cooperative principles
    including open membership and democratic control.
This is an open-access system; the public is welcome.  However,
    regular users are encouraged to become members and help
    support the system financially.  Voting on system policy
    matters is restricted to members.
This system is specifically NOT intended for any illegal purpose.
Users are asked to be considerate of others, and are especially
    asked to make a point of setting a good example for those
    few who may from time to time fail to return the favor.
