,i nu.age
,
, XXX Misti thinks this wording sucks.
The next two pieces of information are your birthdate and sex.  Feel free
to enter them or not as your interests in this system dictate.
,i nu.erase
	Erase character.
The erase character allows you to delete the last character.  Most often, it's
set to backspace, which is the same as control-H.  Most keyboards have a key,
often labeled backspace, on the right which generates just this.  On a few
keyboards (including many DEC terminals) there is no such handy key, and you'll
have to hold control down while pressing H, or select some other key.  In the
ancient days of yore, the original Unix pioneers used '#', for some strange
reason.
,i nu.help
--HELP--

Type in "done" if everything's ok, or one of the following:

fullname	sex		loginid 
address		interests	password
telephone	how		erase
occupation	paranoid	kill
computers	shell		interrupt
birthdate	terminal	editor

You can also use:
	print	- to print all things or
	help	- to get this message again.
,i nu.intr
	Interrupt character
The interrupt character allows you to interrupt the current operation and
return you to a command prompt.
	^C	is it on DEC machines and PC-DOS.  (Ok, I know, VMS is weird..)
	^E	MTS
	^?	Many Unix systems
^? is the delete character, and on many terminals it's labelled either <del> or
<rubout>.  Probably those vicious Unix pioneers liked the idea of rubbing out
their processes with the stroke of a key.  Unfortunately, on many IBM-PC's
and clones, it can be hard to find (try control-backspace).  If you can't
find it, or don't like it, ^C is a very good alternative.
, Since this is Unix, it's our default.	<-- not true if the user used
,					<-- it for erase/kill.
,i nu.kill
	The kill character
The kill character is sort of like the erase key, except it gets rid of the
entire line of input instead of just the last character.  (No, silly, it
doesn't kill other users.  Sheese.) Control-U is the usual assignment on DEC
machines.  Control-X is the default on many other machines and networks,
including MTS.  Those silly Unix pioneers used '@', and curiously, it still
works at the Login: prompt (because it's used by a program called Uucp!)
,i nu.loginid
, XXX figure out way to tell user loginid is PUBLIC -- available to all.
Pick a login-id to identify yourself to others and to the system.  3-8
characters in lower-case are recommended, your initials, first name or last
name are reasonable choices.
	examples:	denise	Denise M. Anderson
			fes	Fred Sleator
Avoid funny characters or long, hard to remember or hard to type login ids...
,i nu.mixed
	And now for something completely different

Ok, that completes the funny key business.  It's time for the question and
answer part.  Some of the answers I need to create your account.  All of your
answers will be helpful to the people who own this system.  And, if you choose,
most of your answers will be visible to other users, so that they can find out
you are, and so you can find out who they are.

Just a reminder, please try to use Mixed Case for text input; it's so much
more readable!
,i nu.occup
The next piece of information is your occupation.
,i nu.password
		Passwords...

After this brief message, the system will ask you to pick a secret password.

Important: Write your password and login id SOMEWHERE safe!!!!  (If
you lose it, you may lose your account.)  Don't share your password
with anyone, not even your closest friends and family members.  The
system will not echo your password for security reasons...
(Are your friends watching even now, notebooks handy and pens poised?)
,i nu.private
The following information will be private if you so desire (if you are
"paranoid").  Otherwise, it will be available for inspection by the other
users on the system.  Of course we hope that on this system you will not mind
sharing this information.  Don't worry too much about mis-spellings and so
forth, you'll have plenty of opportunity to review everything and fix anything
that's not quite right.
,i nu.shell
You may now pick your command interpreter, or shell.  (this is the program
that does things "by your command"...)

The following are legal shells:

	 keyword	   what
	cshell	- C shell	(experienced Unix users only)
	shell	- Bourne shell	(experienced Unix users only)
	bbs	- PicoSpan	(the PicoSpan conferencing system)

If you press <RETURN>, you will have picked the default choice of "bbs".  This
is what most users will want, unless they know or are seriously interested in
Unix, and have the documentation.
,i nu.editor
When creating text via PicoSpan, you have two choices:

	old	This uses the traditional PicoSpan text collector.  It's
		 been well tested by thousands of users.  If you have
		 used PicoSpan before, you will likely feel most comfortable
		 with this.

	new	This uses an experimental editor interface that is designed
		 to be easy to use, yet fairly powerful.  Users who like
		 trying new things out are particularly welcome.

Please select one of these choices.
,i nu.sorry
, This message is not intended to show up under ordinary operation.
, It should probably be redone for sites that use this as
, a way of life.  (Including a telephone # for somebody resonsible
, would only be fair.)
,

		Sorry!

Um, I guess we've been having problems with new people on this system.  Your
information has been recorded in a temporary file for later verification.
After this verification is completed, your account will be put online.  Sorry
for the delay!
,i nu.startup
, XXX check phone number
Welcome to Cyberspace Communications' sytem.	(313)973-4739 Ann Arbor, Michigan.

		This SYSTEM

, XXX check final system ram size before going online
This is a Sun-2/170, running Sun's derivation of Unix.  It has 2 megabytes of
RAM and 160 megabytes of winchester disk online.

		What's happening here

, Misti thought the earlier formal wording here didn't transit
, smoothly to the "I" stage.  So, we'll start right off 1st person.
Hi.  I'm a program running on this system.  My name is "newuser", and
I am here to help you, the new user, gain access to this system.
After we finish here, you will have a unique public login-id and a
private (secret) password that will uniquely identify yourself
to the system.  In future sessions, you'll be able to use that login-id
directly rather than me.

I'm going to teach you a very small amount about how to use this system more
effectively.  Then I'm going to move on and ask you a couple of questions.
I'll give you a chance to correct your answers, and then I will craft an
account for you (based on your answers).  After that, I'm done, and I'll let
you on the system with your new account.  But first, some propaganda.
,p
		Manifesto

, XXX Can improve? (shorter?  sweeter?)
This system is intended for the peaceable interchange of ideas.
The members of this system hope to attract a large, diverse, and
	mature group of interesting thinking individuals.
We believe in community education, and spiritual enrichment of the
	users of the system.
We hope in doing so, to contribute to a better informed citizenship,
	better able to contribute to the democratic ideals of this society,
	and make possible a more just (and a more healthy) society.
It should go without saying that system is specifically NOT intended
	for any illegal purpose.
System will be based on the Rochdale cooperative principles, especially
	including open membership, democratic control, and non-profit economics.
This is an open access system, the public is welcome.  However, regular
	users are encouraged to become members and help support this system.
We ask that users be as considerate of others as possible, and particularly
	ask that all make a special point of setting a good example for
	those few who may from time to time fail to return the favour.

Enough propaganda.  Back to the work at hand.
		Funny keys

You will often find text streaming by too rapidly on the screen to read.  You
can use control-S to freeze it, so that you can read it, and then at your
leisure, you can press control-Q to let it flow by again.  The control key
works like a shift--while holding it down, you press the letter key -- S and Q
in this case.  Sometimes, control keys are indicated this way: ^S ^Q ^C ^X.
,p
		EOF

Almost anywhere in Unix where you are expected to type a variable number of
lines, you end your input by typing control-D after the last line.  Since
it's a special key, you don't press <return> or anything after it.  You'll
be able to use control-D in just a bit, every time I give you a chance to
answer a question with more than one line.
,p
		Customizing keys

Many people like choosing their own keys for the next 3 functions.  I'm going
to tell you some popular choices, and give you a "suggested" default, but if
you can't find them on your keyboard, feel free to pick any of the popular
choices, or anything else, if need be.

Couple of hints: Many computers have "cursor" keys and 'other keys that won't
work too well here -- they send a bunch of characters all at once, and that
gets complicated to deal with.  Don't forget, the control key works like shift.
,p
,i nu.term
	Terminal identification.

Some parts of the system can take advantage of your terminal -- if the system
is told what type you are using, and if your terminal is smart enough to do
cursor positioning and a few other things.  For instance, there are several
visual editors on the system (VI, EMACS), and VI, in particular, is specially
optimized to perform well at 1200 baud.  Certain games and other software may
also take advantage of this.

One warning: "crt", "apple", and "ibmpc" will not work; that doesn't give me
enough clues about your terminal.  There are thousands of terminal programs
for the Ibmpc, the macintosh, and so forth, emulating many popular standard
terminals.  You have to tell me *which* popular terminal your PC is emulating.

You can respond with a "?" if you'd like me to print out the list of terminals
I know about.  I know about more than 350 different kinds of terminals, so feel
free to use the interrupt key (~(intr)) to stop me.

If you don't know what's appropriate, just press <return>, and I will assume
your terminal is "dumb", for now.  You can always change things around later,
once you become more familiar with the system.
,i nu.done
logging in ~(loginid) now...
,i nu.install
Installing your new ID

, here's the ignore message: (comma out when through testing.)
, Please ignore: uid/gid=~(uid)/~(gid)
,
,	reconfiguring EOF isn't really quite supported (we want
,	conditional output macros 1st) but other than that...
,
,i nu.eof
		EOF character
Almost anywhere in Unix where you are expected to type a variable number of
lines, you end your input by typing the EOF character after the last line.
On DEC machines (and PC-DOS and many other DEC influenced machines),
this is set to ^Z.  On MTS, it's set to ^C, however, ^D has practically
the same effect.  On Unix, this is just about always set to ^D.  It
is, however, a configurable character.  Warning!--if you select the C-shell
on Unix, you specifically DON'T want control-Z -- that's used by
the new tty driver for job control purposes.

NOTE: while you have have asked me to select another such key, and
I will switch to your new key if you give me one, I am not yet quite
smart enough to tell the rest of Unix about it.  In fact, I'm a bit
surprised you saw this message, since I'm not actually supposed to
tell you that you can change this key!
,
,	dunno if we'll go with this, but for now...
,
,i nu.reserved

As a special curtesy to M-net and its users, we have temporarily reserved
loginid ~(rloginid) for ~(rfullname).  If you are that person, then you should
supply your M-net password at the next prompt.  If you are not, then you
should just hit <return>, and you'll be asked to supply another loginid.

This does not mean we know your M-net password.  All we've done is download the
publically readable password file.  If you supply your M-net password, we will
encrypt it, compare it with the encrypted entry in the password file, & if it
matches, you must be the right person.  However, as long as we're on security
issues, we really ought to point out that supplying your M-net password to us,
or anybody else, is not good practice.  All you really have is our word that we
aren't going to store your M-net password or use it for any purpose other than
validation.  If you are even remotely worried about this, DON'T give us your
M-net password.  Instead, use ``gripe'' (at the login prompt) and find some
other way to prove that you are really you.

If you are not ~(rfullname), then we apologize for the nuisance, but you'll
have to select another loginid, at least for now.  Just hit <return>, & select
another loginid.  If you would still like to use that loginid, please send us
a request (use ``gripe''), and somebody will get back to you.  Just for now,
however, why not select an alternate loginid?
