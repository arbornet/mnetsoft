This is pnewuser; a self-sevice account creation program.  This
runs on grex.org and replaces the older 'newuser' program that ran
on Grex until around 2010.

This program is written in Perl, and requires the following CPAN
modules, in addition to their dependencies.

DateTime;
Email::Valid;
Filesys::Df;
JSON;
Mail::Alias;
Tcl;
Term::ReadLine;
Text::Template::Preprocess;
Text::Template;

Also, it expects that the 'apg' (automatic password generator)
program will be installed somewhere on the system, as well as the
'figlet' program (for generating text CAPTCHAs).

Most of the heavy lifting for actually adding the account is done
by system utilities that are called from newuser.  This program
uses privilege separation and a thin setuid wrapper around whatever
the system provides to do its work.  All the processes needed for
the run are created at the time the program is started, and if any
of those fail, the entire thing aborts (instead of letting the user
enter a bunch of data and *then* failing).

While newuser can detect whether an account with a given login name
exists at the time it runs, it is possible that collisions may
occur; this is most often detected by the return code of the program
that's doing the actual addition.  If that's the case, newuser will
attempt to recover and retry (for instance, by asking for a different
login name).  However, it's possible that those attempts may fail
if, for instance, newuser cannot fork a new privilege separated
process to invoke the system account creation program.
