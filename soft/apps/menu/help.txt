This is the Grex menu shell.  It takes you through menus and lets
you move to other menus or run programs.

If you ever need help, type "help" to see this text.

If you ever want to leave the current menu, type "exit" or enter
the relevant menu key.

Menu keys are usually a single letter; case does not matter.

The system will pause after executing most commands, to let
you see the result of the command.  Just hit the <ENTER> or
<RETURN> key to get back to the menu.
