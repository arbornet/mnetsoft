EXECUTABLES
-----------
The following executable files should be installed in the indicated locations.
Instructions for building them are in the next section.

    castvote
    voting-booth

	These are extremely simple CGI scripts that output the "text/html"
	content header and then invoke suid executables, described next.
	They should be read- and execute-permitted and stored in the 'pw'
	subdirectory of Apache's ScriptAlias directory.  On Grex as currently
	configured, that would be /usr/local/libexec/cgi-bin/pw.
	They are located in ../scripts/.

    webballot
    webcast

	These are binary executables that support the web voting interface.  
	They should be owned by and suid 'voteadm', executable by all, and
	stored in /suid/bin.

    vote

	A simple shell script that exec's the terminal-interface version
	of the vote program.  It should be stored in /usr/local/bin and
	read- and execute-permitted to all.  It is located in ../scripts/.

    board

	This is the terminal-interface version of the vote program.
	It should be owned by and suid 'voteadm', executable by all, and
	located in /suid/bin.

    date2epoch

	A utility to set the start and end times of an election.  See
	the 'CONFIGURING' section below for how to use it.

COMPILING
---------

    cd src
    make all

	This builds board, webballot, webcast, and date2epoch.

INSTALLING
----------

    As root, in the vote directory, do this:

	cp src/{board,webballot,webcast} /suid/bin
	chown voteadm.vote /suid/bin/{board,webballot,webcast}
	chmod 4711 /suid/bin/{board,webballot,webcast}
	cp src/date2epoch /usr/local/bin
	chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/date2epoch

	cp scripts/{castvote,voting-booth} /usr/local/libexec/cgi-bin/pw
	chmod 755 /usr/local/libexec/cgi-bin/pw/{castvote,voting-booth}
	cp scripts/vote /usr/local/bin
	chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/vote

    Note: If /suid is mounted read-only, you will have to change it
    to read-write before copying anything into it, then change it back to
    read-only when done.  See 'man mount' for instructions on how to do this.

CONFIGURING
-----------

    The vote program reads files in /var/spool/vote to display candidate
    lists and other election information.  Votes are recorded in a
    subdirectory of this directory.

    info.txt
	General information about the election.
    info.html
	Same, but html-formatted.
    title
	Title to use for the web ballot page.
    votemsg
	Prompt displayed in the terminal version of the program
	when the user is casting a ballot.
    start, end
	Starting and ending time of the election, expressed in
	"seconds since the Epoch" format (i.e. rather large
	non-human-readable integers).  To set these, use the
	'date2epoch' utility, which accepts arguments 'year',
	'mon', 'mday', 'hour', 'min' and converts this to
	seconds-since-Epoch format, writing the result to
	standard output.  For example, if you want the election
	to start at midnight on December 1, 2006, you'd type:

	    date2epoch 2006 12 1 0 0 > start

	which will output a human-readable form of the date to
	stderr and store the integer form in the file 'start'.
    candlist
	The list of candidates, formatted as follows:
	    1st line: the number of candidates
	    2nd line: the number of board positions to be filled
	    subsequent lines: the candidates, one per line, in
	    the colon-separated format
	    NAME:LOGIN-ID:FULL-PATH-TO-STATEMENT
    votes/
	Directory containing the votes.  Each users vote is stored
	in a file whose name is the login id of the user.  The file
	lists the candidates they voted for, one candidate per line,
	with line lengths blank-padded to 32 characters.

    All files and directories should be owned and readable by 'voteadm', 
    have group 'vote', and be readable by group.

    See the 'examples' directory for examples of the above-mentioned files.
