The polls are open for the voting on the 2007 Grex Board of Directors.
Terms will run from January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2008.  The 
election runs from December 1 through December 15, 2006 (EST).

Although any user of Grex can cast a ballot, only the votes of Grex
members in good standing will be counted in determining the outcome.
See http://cyberspace.org/member.html for information on becoming a member.

If you cast a ballot and change your mind later, you may vote again.  Each
vote replaces any previous one.
