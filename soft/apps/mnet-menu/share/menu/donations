M-NET SUPPORT INFORMATION:
=========================

Access Levels:
------ ------

-  There are 3 basic types of user access:

     Guest:   This is the status of a user when first calling in, and
              access is free to the phone lines beginning at 313/996-4644,
              plus 1 of the Merit ports (host: m-net), and can telnet to 
              M-net.

     Member:  This is a paying user who has access to the member phone
              lines beginning at 313/994-5278, plus the guest phone lines,
              all 3 Merit ports, and can telnet to M-net.

     Patron:  This is a paying user who has access to the patron phone
              lines beginning at 313/994-6352, plus all member and guest
              phone lines, all 3 Merit ports, and can telnet to M-net.  
              Patrons also have access to the Internet services such as
              ftp, telnet, irc, news, etc., as well as M-net games.
              Discounts are available for students (student patron) and
              members of the same household as an existing patron (co-patron),
              with the same access as a regular patron account.
               
     Note:    All user access levels are able to use the popular local 
              conferencing system (bbs), multi-user chat (party), and
              local & Internet e-mail.

              All phone lines trunk-hunt, for example, if you dial into
              the first patron line and all patron lines are busy, you
              will be trunked down to the first open member or guest line.

 Express Requests:
 ------- --------

 - This utility lets you avoid waiting for your payment to arrive via
   the post office, by giving you some additional access upon promise
   of payment.
 
 - You may use the 'express' command to request member or patron access,
   which will generally require up to 36 hours to process, but usually
   is handled the same day.  Some delays may occur during holidays, etc.

     Accounts upgraded to member status via 'express' will gain
     access to all member phone lines upon processing and approval.

     Accounts upgraded to patron status via 'express' will gain access 
     to all patron phone lines upon processing and approval, and access
     to full Internet functions upon receipt of payment.  These accounts
     may start Internet access AND phone lines access upon receipt of 
     payment if you desire (to lengthen Internet access term).
