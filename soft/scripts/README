This directory is for sh/csh/perl/awk/tcl/etc scripts writen by grex staff
and members. The script should be installed here and a *relative* symlink
placed in /usr/local/bin. The file should also be checked into the GrexDoc
CVS repository in the misc/grex-scripts directory.  An entry should be added
in the scriptsymlink directory in misc/ to create the correct symlink.

For example:
    Suppose you've just written "grexfoo". As root, cd to /usr/local/bin and
do an "ln -s ../grex-scripts/grexfoo grexfoo".

Feel free to add to this readme with any useful info.
