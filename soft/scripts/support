Thanks for asking how to support Grex.  You don't have to pay to use Grex,
but users' donations pay all the bills.  If the users don't support Grex,
it may go away. Please support this valuable community resource. 

The best way to support Grex is to become a member.  Members get to:
   - vote in Grex elections (if you've paid for three months or more)
   - receive the 'Wizards In Training' Manual free (again with 3 months)
   - use our Internet link 
  
Organizations may also support Grex and be recognized as Institutional
Members.  Institutional members have the same privileges as regular
members, except the right to vote.

The minimum Membership dues donation - Individual or Institutional - is
$2/month or $18/year (US currency). Send a personal check or a copy of
other ID with your dues. Other donations at any time from members or
non-members are also welcome. Write to treasurer@grex.org for more info.
Send cash, checks, or money orders to:

Cyberspace Communications, Inc.
P.O. Box 4432
Ann Arbor, MI 48106-4432

In addition, you may use a validated PayPal account to make a membership
donation. See http://grex.org/member.xhtml for details.
