  <p>Cyberspace Communication's mission is to provide free
  access to Internet services and to support open, public
  discussion forums. We keep Grex's costs to about US$150 per
  month by using modern equipment and colocation and lots of volunteer
  work, but we still need to bring in some money to pay for Internet
  connectivity, phones, electricity, and rent and to keep the
  system growing. We charge no fees for our services and run no
  advertisements on our system. We have no government funding and
  no large corporate sponsors. All our money comes from voluntary
  donations from our charitable users like you. If you can afford
  to donate something to help us, we hope you will do so.</p>

  <p>The best way to help support Grex is to become a member.
  Benefits include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Members get to feel good about helping to make a unique
    community resource possible.</li>

    <li>Members get to help plan Grex's future by voting in Grex
    elections (if you've paid for three months or more), running
    for Grex Board of Directors (you must be able to attend
    meetings), and calling for member referenda. See the
    discussions in the
    <a href="/cgi-bin/backtalk/peek:coop">Grex Co-op conference</a>
    for more information.</li>

    <li>Members can use our Internet link for such services as
    outbound ftp, irc, and telnet.</li>

    <li>Cyberspace Communications is an
    <a href="../cyberspace/501c3.xhtml">approved 501(c)3 tax-exempt
    organization</a> so Grex memberships are fully tax
    deductable.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you have questions about membership, first see
  <a href="../memfaq.xhtml">the membership FAQ</a>. If you don't
  find what you're looking for there, contact our treasurer
  (<a href="mailto:treasurer@grex.org">treasurer@grex.org</a>).</p>

  <h3>Paying Dues by Check or Money Order</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Membership dues are US$2 per month or US$18 per
    year.  You can send a check payable to "Cyberspace Communications"
    or "Grex" to</p>

    <blockquote>
      <address><em>Cyberspace Communications, Inc.<br />
      P.O. Box 4432<br />
      Ann Arbor, MI 48106-4432 (USA)</em></address>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Be sure to tell us your Grex login name. If you
    pay other than by personal check, please include a photocopy of
    some ID. (As a membership organization, the law requires that
    we be able to identify our members, but we do not publicize
    your identity.)</p>

    <p>If you are paying for three months or more, you can request
    a free copy of our <a href="wizard.xhtml">Wizard in Training</a>
    user handbook.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Paying Dues by Credit Card</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <p>You can pay membership dues by credit card by buying them
    through the Grex store shopping cart system.</p>

    <p><span class="large"><span class="red"><strong>Important
      Notes:</strong></span></span></p>

    <ol>
      <li>Be sure to <strong>include your Grex login in the
      comments area</strong> in your order so we can figure out
      which of the thousands of accounts on Grex needs to be
      given member status!</li>

      <li>If you are paying for three months or more, you can use
      the comments area to request one free copy of our
      <a href="wizard.xhtml">Wizard in Training</a> user handbook.</li>

      <li>If the name on the credit card is not your own, and you
      are starting a new membership, then you still need to send us
      a photocopy of other ID, as described above.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can pay on a monthly basis, or save some money and pay
    annually. Select the number of months or years you want below,
    click the appropriate "Add to Shopping Cart" button, and then
    click the button to purchase shopping cart contents.</p>

    <p><strong>Credit card processing is currently down. To
    become a member right now, please mail in check. Thanks for
    understanding.</strong></p>
