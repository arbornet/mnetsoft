      <h1>Help Grex buy a new computer!</h1>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Grex is about to buy a new computer! It will probably cost
  somewhere between US$2000 and US$2500 when all is said and done.</p>

  <p>Grex's old Sun 460 has served us well since 1997. A new
  machine should mean everything works faster, and also that we'll
  once again be able to keep up with new software that comes out.
  It may also allow Grex to offer new services. (The discussion of
  what the new hardware will be is in <a href=
  "http://grex.org/cgi-bin/backtalk/peek:coop,176">this
  item</a>).</p>

  <p>In 2001 a generous user donated US$1024 to be used for
  upgrading Grex. That's almost half of what we need for the job,
  and this item's goal is to raise as much of the rest as possible.</p>

  <p><strong>So</strong>, please help Grex to pay for the new machine by
  pledging whatever you can afford. If you have never sent money to
  Grex before, but feel that you benefit from Grex's existence,
  this is an opportunity to see a real tangible benefit for your
  donations.</p>

  <p>Since Grex is a registered 501(c)3 corporation, all donations
  are tax- deductable.</p>

  <p>Donations by check or money order may be sent to:</p>
