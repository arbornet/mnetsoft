The deadline for nominations and acceptances shall be March 30.

4.05 _Annual Election_. The annual election shall begin on April 14 and continue through April 21. The election shall be conducted by electronic means on M-Net.  No write-in votes shall be permitted.  Each eligible patron may cast as many votes as the number of seats to be elected, but not more than one (1) vote per candidate.

This report shall also appear in the minutes of the next Board of Directors meeting. Tie votes shall be resolved by lot.

4.09. _Initiative._ A patron eligible to vote may initiate a policy (not including staff matters or the expenditure of funds) by posting a discussion item in the active M-Net policy conference.
(a) The initiative must remain available for discussion for at least two weeks before being voted on.  The initiator may at that time revise the motion for clarity if desired.  The initiator may also drop the initiative or continue it as originally written. 
(b) If the initiative continues to a vote, the president shall appoint an election committee, who will conduct the vote via electronic means on M-Net.
(c) The vote period shall begin one week after the initiative is finalized, and shall last for one week.  A majority of all participating patrons must vote yes in order to approve the initiative.  The Election Committee shall certify and publish the results, and the secretary shall include their report in the minutes of the next Board of Directors meeting.
(d) If approved, the initiative shall become policy as if the Board of Directors had adopted it.
