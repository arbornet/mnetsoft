     <pre>
10.01 _Non-Derivative Actions_.  Subject to other provisions of
this Article and to the extent permitted by law, the corporation
shall provide for the indemnification and reimbursement of any
person made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the
right of the corporation), by reason of the fact that such person,
or a person whose legal representative or successor he or she is,

(a) is or was a director, officer or employee or agent of the
corporation; or

(b) is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a
director, member of an executive committee, officer, agent or
employee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture trust
or other such enterprise, for expenses (including attorney's fees)
and the amount of any judgment, money decree, fine, penalty,
settlement (if such settlement is approved by the Board of
Directors) or other cost actually and reasonably incurred by him
or her in connection with the defense or settlement of such
proceeding or any appeal therefrom.


10.02 _Determination that Indemnification is Proper_. Any
indemnification under this Article (unless ordered by a court of
competent jurisdiction) shall only be made by the corporation upon
a determination that the person to be indemnified acted in good
faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be
in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, and,
in the case of any criminal proceeding, that such person had no
reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
Such determination shall be made in one of the following ways: (a)
by the Board of Directors by a majority of a quorum consisting of
directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding;
or (b) by independent legal counsel to the corporation in a
written opinion that such indemnification is proper.  The
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its
equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the
person did not act in good faith or in a manner reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the
corporation nor, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, create a presumption that the person had reasonable
cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.

10.03 _Expenses of Successful Defense_.  To the extent that a
person has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense
of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Section 9.01 of
these bylaws or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein,
that person shall be indemnified against expenses (including
attorney's fees) actually and reasonably incurred by that person
in connection therewith.

10.04 _Expense Advance_.  Expenses incurred in defending an action
described in Section 9.01 of this Article may be paid by the
corporation in advance of a determination that such
indemnification is proper upon receipt by a written guarantee by
or on behalf of the person involved to repay such amount unless it
is later determined that such person is entitled to
indemnification in accordance with these bylaws.

10.05 _Former Directors and Officers_.  The indemnification
provided in the foregoing Sections continues as to a person who
has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such a person.

10.06 _Insurance_.  The corporation may purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted
against and incurred by that person in any such capacity, or
arising out of such status, whether or not the corporation would
have power to indemnify him or her against such liability under
these bylaws or the laws of the State of Michigan. The Board of
Directors may also purchase insurance to protect any property or
equipment belonging to the corporation, on behalf of the
corporation, as part of the Board's routine duties.

10.07 _Changes in Michigan Law_. In the event of any change of the
Michigan statutory provisions applicable to the corporation
relating to the subject matter of Article IX of these bylaws, then
the indemnification to which any person shall be entitled
hereunder shall be determined by such changed provisions.  The
Board of Directors is authorized to amend these bylaws to conform
to any such changed statutory provisions.

the meeting includes notice of the proposed amendment,
