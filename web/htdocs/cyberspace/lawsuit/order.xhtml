    <h2>ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS MOTION<br />
    FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND<br />
    PERMANENTLY ENJOINING DEFENDANTS<br />
    FROM ENFORCING MICHIGANS 1999 PUBLIC ACT 33</h2>
  </div>

  <h2>I. Introduction <sup>1</sup></h2>On July 29, 1999, the Court
  issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Governor Engler,
  Attorney General Granholm, and their officers, agents, servants,
  employees, and attorneys from enforcing Michigan's 1999 Public
  Act 33. The injunction was to remain in effect until further
  order of this Court.

  <p>The facts of this case, as contained in the stipulated
  records, affidavits, and witness testimony, are not in dispute.
  The defendants appealed this Court's decision to grant
  preliminary injunctive relief. The United States Court of Appeals
  for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the decision of this Court. The
  appellate court held that any final conclusions on the ultimate
  issues of a case were premature and inappropriate for decision at
  the preliminary injunction stage. <u>Cyberspace Communications v.
  Engler</u>, No. 99-2064 (6<sup>th</sup> Cir. Nov. 15, 2000).
  Consequently, the Sixth Circuit, <em>per curiam</em>, remanded the
  cause for further proceedings, to afford the parties the
  opportunity to argue the merits of the plaintiffs' claims.</p>

  <p>The Court conducted a status conference after remand. The
  parties were given sufficient time to submit supplemental briefs
  regarding the ultimate issues in the case. Plaintiffs filed a
  Motion for Summary Judgment. Defendants filed a Brief in
  Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court,
  having been fully advised on the premises of the issues, HEREBY
  GRANTS Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and PERMANENTLY
  ENJOINS enforcement of Michigan's 1999 Public Act 33.</p>

  <h2>II. Background</h2>The pertinent facts of this case were set
  forth in detail in this Court's July 29, 1999 Findings of Fact
  and Conclusions of Law Regarding Plaintiffs' Motion for
  Injunctive Relief, Cyberspace <u>Communications v. Engler</u>, 55
  F.Supp.2d 737 (E.D.Mich. 1999). The standing of the plaintiffs to
  bring this cause of action<sup>2</sup>, the nature and types of
  communication and information exchanged on the Internet, and the
  language of Michigan's 1999 Public Act 33 remain largely
  unchanged from March 9, 2000 to the present. Therefore, the Court
  adopts by reference the findings of fact, the stipulations of the
  parties, the description of the parties, and the conclusions of
  law recited in the Court's July 29, 1999 Order.

  <h2>III. Standard of Review</h2>Summary judgment, "shall be
  rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to
  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the
  affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
  material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment
  as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).

  <h2>IV. Analysis</h2>The plaintiffs' brief notes that, in the
  time that has elapsed since the Court issued the preliminary
  injunction in this case, two other circuits have enjoined the
  enforcement of statutes that attempt to regulate Internet
  content. In <u>ACLU v. Reno</u> ("<u>Reno II</u>"), 217 F.3d 162
  (3<sup>rd</sup> Cir. 2000), the Third Circuit affirmed the
  decision of the United States District Court for the Eastern
  District of Pennsylvania, which preliminarily enjoined the
  enforcement of the Child Online Protection Act ("COPA"), 47
  U.S.C. � 231.

  <p>In <u>ACLU v. Johnson</u>, 194 F.3d 1149 (10<sup>th</sup> Cir.
  1999), the Tenth Circuit affirmed the decision of the United
  States District Court for the District of New Mexico, which
  preliminarily enjoined the enforcement of a New Mexico statute,
  N.M. St. � 30-37-3.2(A). Additionally, the United States District
  Court for the Western District of Virginia has likewise entered a
  preliminary injunction, prohibiting enforcement of a similar
  Virginia statute, Va.Code Ann. � 18.2-391. <u>PSINET, Inc. v.
  Chapman</u>, 108 F.Supp.2d 611 (W.D. Va. 2000).</p>

  <p>The Court, in granting Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary
  injunction, reviewed the standards and law applicable to
  injunctive relief. At that time, the Court found that there was a
  substantial likelihood that Plaintiffs would ultimately be
  successful in proving the merits of their claims. After
  consideration of the parties' supplemental briefs after remand,
  the Court hereby finds Plaintiffs' claims to be meritorious.</p>

  <h3>A. First Amendment Challenge</h3>The Court's July 29, 1999
  Order noted that any content-based limitation on speech may be
  upheld only if the state demonstrates the restriction is both
  necessary to achieve a compelling state interest, and is narrowly
  tailored to achieve that feat. <u>Perry Education Association v.
  Perry Local Educators Association</u>, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983).
  The Court recognizes that the State has a compelling interest to
  protect minor children, including the interest of protecting
  children from exposure to obscene materials. However, Defendants
  have failed to demonstrate that 1999 Public Act 33 will further a
  compelling interest of the State of Michigan.

  <p>Plaintiffs offered the testimony, at a prior hearing, of an
  expert who testified that other, less-intrusive means to filter
  the reception of obscene materials exist. A parent may utilize
  filters or child-friendly software to accomplish similar
  restrictions. The Court previously took judicial notice that
  every computer is manufactured with an on/off switch, that
  parents may utilize, in the end, to control the information which
  comes into their home via the Internet.</p>

  <p>Thus, despite the fact that protection of minors is a
  compelling state interest, the Court finds that 1999 Public Act
  33 is neither narrowly tailored nor does it apply the least
  restrictive means available to achieve that goal. Consequently,
  the Court finds that Michigan's 1999 Public Act 33 violates the
  First Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>

  <h3>B. Commerce Clause Challenge</h3>A state's power to regulate
  commerce may be limited by the right of Congress to regulate
  interstate commerce. U.S. Const. Art. I, � 8, cl. 3. Michigan's
  effort to regulate what information may be transmitted to
  Michigan's children, via the Internet, attempts to control
  Internet communications which might originate within Michigan, in
  other states, or in other countries. The Commerce Clause
  precludes the application of state statutes to commerce that
  commences or occurs outside of a state's borders. <u>American
  Libraries Association v. Pataki</u>, 969 F.Supp. 160, 175 (S.D.
  N.Y. 1997).

  <p>"[A] statute that directly controls commerce occurring wholly
  outside the boundaries of a State exceeds the inherent limits of
  the enacting State's authority and is invalid regardless of
  whether the statute's extraterritorial reach was intended by the
  legislature." <u>Healy v. The Beer Institute</u>, et al., 491
  U.S. 324, 336 (1989). Thus, regardless of the legislature's
  intent to regulate solely within the State's own borders, the Act
  would, in effect, attempt to control communications occurring
  outside of the State of Michigan. Therefore, Michigan's 1999
  Public Act 33 would violate the Dormant Commerce Clause of the
  United States Constitution, and may not be enforced.</p>

  <h3>C. Defendants' Request for Limitation of
  Relief</h3>Defendants argue that, if the Court does grant relief
  to Plaintiffs, the relief should be limited to the enforcement of
  those provisions of the Act which pertain to Internet
  dissemination of sexually explicit materials to children.
  However, "the general federal rule is that courts do not rewrite
  statutes to create constitutionality." <u>Eubanks v.
  Wilkinson</u>, 937 F.2d 1118, 1122 (6 th Cir. 1991). It is the
  role of the Michigan Legislature to craft Michigan statutes. The
  Court will refrain from dissecting the unconstitutional
  provisions of the Act merely to save any portions which may not
  violate the Constitution. Therefore, Defendants' request to limit
  relief in this case is denied.

  <h2>V. Conclusion</h2>The Court finds that there are no genuine
  issues of material fact which would preclude judgment as a matter
  of law in this case. Michigan's 1999 Public Act 33 violates the
  First Amendment and the Dormant Commerce Clause of the United
  State Constitution. Consequently, Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary
  Judgment IS HEREBY GRANTED.

  <p>For the reasons stated herein, as well as the reasons
  previously stated in this Court's July 29, 1999 Order, the Court
  holds that the Michigan's 1999 Public Act 33 is unconstitutional.
  Therefore,</p>

  <p>IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants Michigan Governor John
  Engler and Michigan Attorney General Jennifer Granholm, in their
  official capacities, and the State of Michigan ARE PERMANENTLY
  RESTRAINED AND ENJOINED from enforcing any provision of 1999
  Public Act 33.</p>

  <p>Judgment Shall Be Entered Accordingly.</p>
