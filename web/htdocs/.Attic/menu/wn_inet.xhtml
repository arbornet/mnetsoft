<body>
  <h1>What's new on the Internet</h1>Every minute there must be
  thousands of new things posted on the web. We have no way of
  tracking them here. On the other hand, this page has been
  neglected by the Grex webmasters for 4 years, so even though so
  much is new, nothing is new on this page.

  <p>If we ever get our act together, we will post web novelties
  here. Until we do, please accept our apologies.</p>
