<body>
  An editor is the program that is used to create and edit files.
  Some of the ones available on Grex are: pico, vi, jove, ed and
  bbsed. Once you select an editor in your options file, you can
  easily edit documents you are viewing by typing "e".

  <p>If you don't yet have a favorite editor, "pico" is a nice one
  to start with. It has help available on the screen.</p>

  <p>For more info on editors, check out our <a href=
  "/usr/local/www/exec/editors.html">Editors</a> page.</p>
