  <title>Determining Your Terminal Type</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Determining Your Terminal Type</h1><em>If you're using a
  communications program</em> to call GREX, chances are your
  terminal type is 'ansi' or 'vt100'. Look at your screen for the
  help menus to find something like this. If you can't find
  anything, use the 'ansi-simple' terminal type. (Type it without
  the quotes marks.)

  <p><em>If you're calling on an old fashioned terminal</em> and
  you can't find the model, type 'dumb' (without the quotes).</p>

  <p>This will get you started, and you can always change your
  terminal type later using the "modify" program, if you want
  to.</p>
