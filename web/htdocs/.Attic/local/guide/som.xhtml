  <title>Some Helpful Concepts</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Some Helpful Concepts</h1>A <em>conference</em> is a group of
  people discussing multiple related topics of mutual interest over
  time.

  <p>GREX has many interesting conferences, and you can participate
  in as many of them as you like.</p>

  <p>An <em>item</em> is a specific discussion started by a GREX
  user about an idea related to the conference's main subject.</p>

  <p>A conference contains many items. After you read an item, you
  can make your own response to it if you choose. Items become a
  permanent part of the conference, and can be read at any time by
  any interested GREX user.</p>

  <p>A <em>response</em> is a comment added to the end of an item.
  Over time, an item may collect many responses.</p>

  <p>You can easily scan what's new in the discussions; review
  things you read earlier; and filter out areas of discussion that
  you don't find interesting.</p>
