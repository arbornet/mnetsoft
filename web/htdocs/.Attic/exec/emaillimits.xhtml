  <title>E-Mail Limitations</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Limitations for email</h1>Because the Grex system is paid for
  by donations, we are unable to aford an expensive high-speed
  internet connection. On our low-speed connection, problems arise
  unless users are good citizens. Therefore, the hard-working staff
  of Grex request that you limit your use of email in the following
  ways.

  <ul>
    <li>Please limit the length of incoming and outgoing messages
    to 100k.</li>

    <li>Please do not store mail in your inbox for long periods of
    time.</li>

    <li>Please do not set up mail aliases of large mailing
    lists.</li>

    <li>If you keep sent or received mail in folders, please
    download those folders to your home computer on a regular
    basis. Disk space is at a premium.</li>
  </ul>
