  <title>Unix Shells</title>

  <h1>Access to Unix Shells and Development tools</h1>If you are
  interested in using a Unix command shell, you may do so at any
  time, even if Lynx is your login shell. This is not recommended
  for users who are not familiar with Unix, but for those who are,
  it is not at all discouraged either.

  <p>All the Grex staff requests is that you be a good citizen. We
  all have to share this machine, and some of its resources are
  limited. We have seen all kinds of hacks designed to take the
  system down or otherwise harass users, and we are granting this
  access with the understanding that you are far too mature to try
  to do something like that with it. The shells currently installed
  are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>sh, <a href="lynxexec:sh">Bourne Shell</a>, the basic
    one</li>

    <li>csh, <a href="lynxexec:csh">C Shell</a></li>

    <li>tcsh, <a href="lynxexec:tcsh">Turbo C Shell</a>, an
    enhanced C Shell</li>

    <li>bash, <a href="lynxexec:bash">Bourne-Again Shell</a> from
    GNU</li>
  </ul>Remember to return to Lynx from any shell by issuing the
  exit command.
