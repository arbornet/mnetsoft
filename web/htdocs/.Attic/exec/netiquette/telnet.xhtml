  <h1>Remote Login (Telnet) Netiquette</h1>
  <pre>
 When you telnet to a remote system, you should always 
 remember that you are using that system's CPU, storage, and 
 other resources including network resources. To ensure that 
 other Internet users have access to the same information in a 
 timely manner, remote users should observe the following 
 courtesies:
 
 -  Logoff a remote computer system when finished. Because 
 most systems have a limited number of resources, it's 
 considered good manners to close your connection if it's not 
 actively being used.
 
 -  Be sensitive about whether you are creating requests that 
 may consume a disproportionate amount of CPU time. 
 
 -  Screen-captured data or information should be downloaded 
 to your personal computer's hard drive.
