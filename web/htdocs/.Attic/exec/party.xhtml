  <h1>Party</h1>"Party" is a program that lets you exchange
  one-line messages with a group of people. Anyone logged into Grex
  may use party. From here, you may <a href="lynxexec:pwho">see who
  is using party</a> at the moment.

  <p>Select <a href="lynxexec:party">here</a> to enter party
  yourself. While you're in "party", type h to get help, or type a
  response for others to see. Before you enter a response, you must
  hit the space bar so the party program knows you're not entering
  a command for it.</p>

  <p>There are also <a href="partyadv.html">other things</a> you
  can do involving the party program.</p>
