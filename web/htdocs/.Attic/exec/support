Thanks for asking about how to support Grex.  Although you don't have to pay
to use Grex, our users pay all the bills.  If the users don't support Grex,
it may go away.
 
The best way to support Grex is to become a member.  Members get to:
   - vote in Grex elections (if you've paid for three months or more)
   - post articles to Usenet.
   - use our Internet link.
 
Plus, you also get the warm and fuzzy feeling of having helped out a
valuable community resource.
 
Memberships cost $6/month or $60/year (US currency).  Send cash, checks,
or money orders to:
 
Cyberspace Communications, Inc.
P.O. Box 4432
Ann Arbor, MI 48106-4432
 
Non-membership contributions are welcome, too.  If you're interested in
making such a donation (monetary or otherwise), please send mail to danr
for more info.
THANKS!
