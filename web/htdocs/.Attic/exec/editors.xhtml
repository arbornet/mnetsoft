  <title>Editors</title>

  <h1>Editors available on Grex</h1>There are many editors
  installed on Grex for you to choose from. Deciding which editor
  is best usually starts strong diagreements, so we'll deem it
  sufficient to say that each different editor has different
  capabilities and different people who like them.

  <ul>
    <li>There's <a href="lynxexec:vi">vi</a>, which is a nearly
    ubiquitous editor on unix machines. For a quick introduction,
    click <a href="../local/popcorn/chapter5.2.3">here</a>. To
    escape from it if you're trapped, type the escape character
    followed by :q!</li>

    <li>There is GNU <a href="lynxexec:emacs">emacs</a>, which is a
    very powerful and configurable editor. It is much loved by Unix
    users who are used to it. Exit with ^X^C.</li>

    <li>There's <a href="lynxexec:pico">pico</a>, which stands for
    PIne COmposer. It is the text collector for the <a href=
    "lynxexec:pine">"pine"</a> mailer. It has a command menu on the
    screen, so it is quite easy for beginners to learn.</li>

    <li>There is <a href=
    "lynxexec:sh%20/usr/local/www/exec/bbsed.sh">bbsed</a>, which
    is a "line editor." That means that you can enter one line of
    text at a time. It's a nice choice for dumb terminal software.
    We have a <a href="../local/files/bbsed.html">bbsed
    introduction</a> to help you use it.</li>
  </ul>
