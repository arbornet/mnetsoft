  <h1>Outgoing Internet Services on Grex</h1>Lynx can provide
  access to the internet for many of its common protocols. Access
  is limited to paying members on certain ports. Free accounts
  should be able to access http and gopher servers as long as they
  are operating on the normal service port for that service. Lynx
  also supports ftp, telnet and other protocols, but the Grex
  kernel blocks outgoing connections on those and on non-standard
  http ports such as 8000 and 8080 except for members.

  <p>If you are interested in membership, see <a href=
  "../member.html">the Grex Membership Page</a>.</p>

  <p>In order to use these facilities, you may check out the
  <a href="../menu/main_menu.html">Internet Connection Page</a> or
  else just type the "g" command at any time and you will be
  prompted for a URL. This stands for "Universal Resource Locator"
  and has a form like telnet://grex.cyberspace.org/ or
  http://cad.ucla.edu/repository/useful/iching.html</p>

  <p>To use anonymous ftp from within Lynx, enter:</p>
  <pre>
                ftp://sitename
</pre>For example, to connect to ftp.uml.edu to download some files
about Babylon 5, hit the "g" key, then enter "ftp://ftp.uml.edu"
without the quotes. Lynx will list the directories, you can then
select Babylon-5 to enter that directory, and select a file to
download it.

  <p>You can access gopher, WAIS, and telnet similarly:</p>
  <pre>
                gopher://sitename
                wais://sitename
                telnet://sitename
</pre>If you want to telnet to a specific port, just enter:
  <pre>
                telnet://sitename:portnumber
</pre>
