  <h2>Hi! We are always delighted to have new volunteers!</h2>

  <p>One of the things that Grex needs most urgently is more people to
  answer "write help" requests. That's where people who want to be
  helpers set a "helper flag", and then when other people type
  "write help", they are matched up with a helper so that the
  helper can talk on-line to them, to help with the person's
  question. To turn on your helper flag, run the Unix command "mesg
  -h y". If you always want to be a helper, you'll want to put that
  command in your shell's startup file. Some other tips for new
  helpers:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Check out Grex's "helpers" conference (go to the bbs and
    type "join helpers"). This isn't required, but it is
    recommended that you look around there initially, and then
    check back again once in a while.</li>

    <li>Don't set your account to the "only receive tels but not
    writes" setting. (If you don't know what that is, don't worry.)
    That setting is confusing to the people who need help.</li>

    <li>You might want to look around in the "info" conference, to
    see what kind of questions about Grex are common, and the
    answers to them. This, too, is optional. The info conference is
    *huge*, and you certainly don't have to read everything there.
    Some of it is fairly outdated, too.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Also, there are other staff tasks to be done. The way to find
  other things to volunteer for is to follow the "co-op"
  conference. That is where the decisions that affect Grex are
  made. Through the discussions in the co-op conference, you'll get
  to know the staff, and the staff will get to know you. We add new
  staffers from the pool of people we know and trust, who we've
  generally gotten to know through the conferences.</p>

  <p>Finally, yet another conference to follow is the "garage"
  conference. That is where more of the technical plans for Grex
  are discussed. It's a good place to get to know Grex's current
  hardware and software issues, and it's another place to talk to
  the staff.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt that new qualified trustworthy staff members
  would be welcome. It is possible to become involved with the
  operation of Grex without being physically located in Ann Arbor,
  or even in the USA.</p>

  <p>However, Staff members for Grex are not recruited, or even
  accepted, from the general internet population. In order to
  qualify to work on the system, you must first become a part of
  the Grex governing community. This community meets constantly in
  the <a href="/cgi-bin/backtalk/peek:coop">Grex coop conference</a>, and
  everyone is free to join it. You can participate by telnetting in
  and running the picospan bbs interface, or you can participate in
  Grex conferences via the web using our
  <a href="/backtalk.html">Backtalk interface</a></p>

  <p>Once you are a familiar face (so to speak) to the Grex staff,
  and it has become clear to us that you are responsible, have the
  required technical knowledge and the desire to help, it may be
  possible to become involved in certain maintenance
  responsibilities. It's a lot like getting a job, except you don't
  get paid.</p>
