  </div>

  <p>You came to this page because you cannot get connect to Grex.
  there are a number of reasons that this can happen.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#client">Read this section</a> if you do not know
    how to SSH. Perhaps you do not have a SSH client, or do
    not know what the command is.</li>

    <li><a href="#browser">Read this section</a> if when you click
    on a <a href="ssh://grex.org">ssh link</a>, your browser
    gives you an error, such as "unable to find application".</li>

    <li><a href="#connect">Read this section</a> if you can ssh,
    but you can't get a response from Grex.</li>

    <li><a href="#other">Read this section</a> if you are having
    some other problem with ssh.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href=".">Return to the main trouble page</a>.</p>
  <hr />

  <h3><a id="client">Your SSH Client</a></h3>In
  order to make a ssh connection to Grex, you need an ssh
  client. It is likely that you already have one, because most
  modern systems come with one built in.

  <p>There are several cases to consider, depending on what kind of
  machine and connection you are using:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you have a PC running a 32-bit Windows operating system
    (Window 95, 98, NT, 7, 10), then you are unlikely to have an ssh program
    built in.  grex requires ssh for connecting, so you would need to install
    an ssh client.  If this doesn't work, <a href="#top">go back to the
    top of this page</a>, and make another selection.

      <p>Please see the <a href="../ssh.xhtml">Grex ssh
      Page</a> for information about alternate ssh programs.</p>
    </li>

    <li>If you are running an older version of Windows or Windows
    for Workgroups on your PC, you may not have a built in ssh
    program, and you may also need TCP/IP stack software. See the
    <a href="../ssh.xhtml">Grex ssh Page</a> for information
    on how to get what you need.</li>

    <li>If you have a Macintosh, you need a ssh client program.
    See the <a href="../ssh.xhtml">Grex ssh page</a> for
    information about Macintosh ssh clients.</li>

    <li>If you are using a terminal emulator, then it does not matter
    whether you are connecting from a Macintosh, or PC. You will be
    running the ssh client on the host machine, which is usually a
    unix machine. If you are dialing into a Free-net or Community
    network, using a terminal emulator, you may be presented with a
    menu of options. You will need to get help from the people who
    run that machine to find out how to do an ssh connection from
    it. If you are able to access a unix command prompt, or if your own
    machine is a unix machine, then you should be able to type "ssh
    **username**@grex.org" to start the connection to Grex (substitute
    your Grex user name for **username**). You do not need a special ssh
    client, because it is built in to all unix systems.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a id="browser">If Your Browser Cannot
  ssh</a></h3>This occurs when your browser has not been
  configured to know where your ssh client is located. To
  correct this, you must configure your browser. There is a
  slightly different way to do this for each different browser. 
  Generally, there is a way to assign ssh connections to an
  application.  Assign ssh connections to your ssh client.
  If you do not know what your ssh client is, then you should <a href=
  "#client">read the previous section</a> of this page.

  <p>Once you have selected a good ssh client program to be your
  browser's ssh application, your browser should not have any
  further trouble following ssh links.</p>

  <h3><a id="connect">If You Cannot Connect to
  Grex</a></h3>There are a number of reasons why this might be
  happening:

  <ul>
    <li>Your DNS is not configured properly. This can easily be
    tested. Try sshing to Grex's IP address. Of course you have
    to know the IP address. We can tell you that at the time this
    page was last updated, Grex's IP address was 162.202.67.158, but
    it may change at any time. If you are in doubt, <a href=
    "/cgi-bin/grexip/">view this page</a> to see if it has changed.
    Try substituting that IP address for the name "grex.org" when
    you ssh, to see if it works any better. If it does, then you
    have a problem with your machine's configuration for DNS. You
    really need to correct this problem, because you should not
    rely on the IP address to remain constant. In order to
    configure DNS properly on your machine, you will need to
    contact your Internet Access Provider's system help desk, or
    help website.

      <p>If, on the other hand, this does not help, then DNS is not
      your problem.</p>
    </li>

    <li>You are connected to the net via a firewall. A firewall is
    a router that filters (blocks) certain packets. Firewalls are
    usually installed to protect private networks, or to limit the
    usage of certain services. Users connecting from corporate
    intranets are most likely to encounter firewalls. Very often it
    is possible to ssh through a firewall, but unfortunately, we
    cannot help you find a way to do this. If you need to traverse
    a firewall to get access to the internet, you should contact
    the firewall or security administrator on your intranet and ask
    how to make a ssh connection to the internet.</li>

    <li>Grex might be down at the moment, or there may be
    disruptions in the proper functioning of the internet. In this
    case, there is little you can do except wait a while, and try
    again later. If Grex were down, or the network were broken,
    though, it is not likely that you would be seeing this page,
    because it is provided by Grex's web server, unless perhaps you
    are looking at a copy of it that was cached by your browser
    when the connection to Grex was clear.</li>

    <li>Your domain or IP address is in a black or block list. Grex
    subscribes to several lists which contain IP address known to
    be associated with illegal activity.  Unfortunately, some of these
    may be dynamically assigned by your Internet Service Provider,
    and you may be blocked from connecting to Grex.  Ideally, this is
    something your ISP should take care of (e.g. removing the IP
    address from block or black lists, or making the IP address
    unavailable to users on their system).  Grex staff may be
    able to help but if the IP address continues to show up on
    black lists, there's not a lot we can do.</li>

    <li>If none of the above seems to apply to you, please fill out
    the following form. The more information you provide, the more
    likely the Grex Staff will be able to help you discover what is
    wrong. Therefore, please take the time to fill the form out
    carefully. The Grex staff will respond by email to your account
    or to the e-mail address you provide, so make sure it is
    correct.
