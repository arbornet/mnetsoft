  <title>Bookmarks</title>
</head>

<body>
  Bookmarks are easy ways to save locations that you like. In
  effect, you can build your own custom menu which can be accessed
  easily.

  <p>To place a bookmark, just type "a" and answer "y" when you are
  viewing the document you want to save. (Be sure you are in the
  document and not merely pointing to it.)</p>

  <p>To go to a bookmark, just type "v" (for "view") and then
  select from among the options you have saved.</p>

  <p>This information is saved in a <a href=
  "bookm_file.html">bookmark file</a> which you can edit with your
  editor of choice.</p>
