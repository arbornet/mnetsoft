  <title>To Chat With Another User in Real-time</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>To Chat With Another User in Real-time</h1>You may see a
  message like this while you're using GREX:

  <blockquote>
    <em>...Message from mju on tty00 at Wed Jun 2 00:12 1993
    EDT</em>
  </blockquote>This means that user "mju" wants to talk privately
  with you. To respond, type:

  <blockquote>
    write
  </blockquote>Everything you type will show up on both screens.

  <p>To avoid confusion, it's customary to end each of your
  transmissions by typing an "o" (for "over") on its own line. Once
  you've done so, you should wait for the other person to signal
  that he or she is finished before you type again.</p>

  <p>When you're finished with the conversation, type "oo" (for
  "over and out) on its own line. When the other person responds
  with oo, you can type ctrl-D to return to what you were
  doing.</p>

  <p>To initiate a conversation, type:</p>

  <blockquote>
    !write userid
  </blockquote>where userid is that of a GREX user currently
  on-line. See the <a href="se.html">!who</a> command.
