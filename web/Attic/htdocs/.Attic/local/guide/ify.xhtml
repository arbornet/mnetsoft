  <h1>If You Don't Want to be "Chatted" With</h1>To set your
  message permissions "off" so that others can't "chat" with you,
  type:

  <blockquote>
    !mesg n
  </blockquote>at any prompt.

  <p>When you're finished with what you wanted to concentrate on,
  you can set your "perms" on again by typing:</p>

  <blockquote>
    !mesg y
  </blockquote>at any prompt.
