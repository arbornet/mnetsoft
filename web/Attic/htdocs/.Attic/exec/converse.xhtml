  <title>Conversing</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Conversing with other users on Grex</h1>There are basically
  three ways to communicate with other users. <a href=
  "picospan.html">Conferencing</a>, which is public, is one.
  <a href="email.html">E-mail</a>, which is private, is a second.
  The third method is Real-Time communication. This requires that
  the other people must be logged in at the same time.

  <p>There are several approaches to real-time communications: They
  include <a href=
  "lynxexec:sh%20/usr/local/www/exec/write.sh">write</a>, <a href=
  "lynxexec:sh%20/usr/local/www/exec/ntalk.sh">ntalk</a>, and
  <a href="party.html">party</a>.</p>

  <p>There are three ways to find out who is logged onto Grex at
  the moment. They are <a href="lynxexec:w">w</a>, <a href=
  "lynxexec:who">who</a> and <a href="lynxexec:f">finger</a>. Each
  one offers a slightly different amount of data in a slightly
  different format.</p>
