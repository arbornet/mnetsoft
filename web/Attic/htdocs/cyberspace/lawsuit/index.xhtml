    <h1>Cyberspace v. Engler</h1>
  </div>

  <p>Betweeen June of 1999 and July of 2001, Cyberspace
  Communications participated in an ACLU lawsuit seeking to
  overturn as unconstitutional a Michigan state law that would
  makes it illegal to transmit "sexually explicit" material to
  minors. This law was too broad, eroded the First Amendment right
  to free speech, and would have been impossible for a grass roots
  organizations like Cyberspace Communications to comply with. The
  lawsuit succeeded and the law was overturned. This web site
  provides information about the suit.</p>

  <h2>Chronology:</h2>
  <p>On June 23, 1999, Cyberspace Communications
  and 8 other plaintiffs filed suit to block the implementation of
  Michigan Public Act 33 of 1999 (The Child Online Protection Act).</p>

  <p>On July 23, 1999, a hearing was held in the U.S. District
  Court in Detroit, Michigan, with Jan Wolter giving testimony for
  Cyberspace Communications before Judge Arthur J. Tarnow.
  Arguments for the plaintiffs were presented by attorney Andrew A.
  Nickelhoff of the Detroit firm of Sachs, Waldman, O'Hare,
  Helveston, Bogas &amp; McIntosh, P.C. On July 29, 1999, Judge
  Tarnow granted a preliminary injunction, preventing the Act from
  being enforced until further legal action was taken.</p>

  <p>In April, 2000, the state appealed the preliminary injuction.
  On October 27, 2000, oral arguments were heard by the U.S. Sixth
  Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. The three judge panel
  consisted of judges Norris, Guy and Hood, three very conservative
  judges all appointed by Presidents Reagan or Bush. Arguments for
  the plaintiffs were again presented by Andrew A. Nickelhoff. Also
  present was Michael A. Bamberger of the New York law firm of
  Sonnenschein Nath &amp; Rosenthal, who filed an
  <a href="amicus.xhtml">amicus brief</a>
  in response to this appeal.  In mid-November of 2000, court upheld
  Judge Tarnow's preliminary injunction.</p>

  <p>On November 15, 2000, the Court of Appeals issued an
  <a href="ruling.xhtml">opinion</a>
  affirming Judge Tarnow's decision to grant a preliminary injunction
  (i.e., upholding Judge Tarnow's decision to stop the Michigan
  Internet Censorship Act from going into effect while the case is
  being litigated). The Court of Appeals opinion is only 2 pages and
  essentially states that Judge Tarnow did not abuse his discretion
  in ruling that the plaintiffs were likely to win the case on its
  merits. The opinion does not address the legal issues in detail and
  it is not going to be published in the law books.</p>

  <p>The case was then returned to the district court court for a
  ruling on the actual constitutionality of the law, as opposed to
  simply deciding if a temporary injunction should be in place. The
  ACLU requested and recieved a summary judgement from the district
  court, so that the court would issue a ruling without further
  hearings. On June 1, 2001, Judge Arthur J. Tarnow issued a
  <a href="order.xhtml">permanent injunction</a>
  against the enforcement of Michigan's 1999 Public Act 33.</p>

  <p>The attorney general decided not to appeal this ruling to a
  higher court, so the law is dead. We won!</p>
