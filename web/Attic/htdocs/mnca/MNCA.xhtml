          formed or existing under or subject to this act: (a)

          derivative thereof, which indicates or implies that the
          corporation is organized for a purpose other than 1 or
          more of the purposes permitted by its articles of
          incorporation.</p>

          <p>(b) Shall not be the same as, or confusingly similar
          to, the corporate name of a domestic corporation, a
          domestic business corporation, a foreign corporation
          authorized to conduct affairs in this state, or a foreign
          business corporation authorized to transact business in
          this state; a corporate name currently reserved under
          this act, a predecessor act, or Act No. 284 of the Public
          Acts of 1972, as amended; or a name assumed under section
          217 or under section 217 of Act No. 284 of the Public
          Acts of 1972, as amended, being section 450.1217 of the

          other domestic corporation, domestic business
          corporation, foreign corporation, or foreign business
          corporation or holder of a reserved name, to the adoption
          of a confusingly similar name, but not the same name, is
          filed in the office of the administrator, or, in lieu of
          the consent, there is filed a certified copy of a final
          judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
          establishing the prior right of the corporation to the
          use of the name in this state.</p>

          prohibited or restricted by any other statute of this
          state, unless the restriction has been complied with.</p>

          <p>(2) Whenever a foreign corporation is unable to obtain
          a certificate of authority to conduct affairs in this
          state because its corporate name does not comply with the
          provisions of subsection (1), it may apply for authority
          to conduct affairs in this state by adding to its
          corporate name in such application a word, abbreviation,
          or other distinctive and distinguishing element, or
          alternatively, adopting for use in this state an assumed
          name otherwise available for use. If in the judgment of
          the administrator this assumed name would comply with the
          provisions of subsection (1), that subsection shall not
          be a bar to the issuance to the corporation of a
          certificate of authority to conduct affairs in this
          state. The certificate issued to the foreign corporation
          shall be issued in this assumed name and the corporation
          shall use this name in all its dealings with the
          administrator and in the conduct of its affairs in this

          <p>Sec. 303. (1) A corporation organized upon a stock
          basis may issue the number of shares authorized in its
          articles of incorporation. Except as otherwise provided
          in this act, the articles of incorporation or bylaws may

          preferences, and limitations, and other rights,
          preferences, and limitations of or upon the shareholders
          of the corporation.</p>

          <p>(2) The articles of incorporation may provide that the
          shares of a corporation shall be all of 1 class or shall
          be divided into 2 or more classes. If the shares are
          divided into 2 or more classes, the shares of each class
          shall be designated to distinguish them from the shares
          of the other classes. Except as otherwise provided in
          this act, each class shall consist of shares of the
          designation and number stated in the articles of
          incorporation, and having relative qualifications,
          liquidation rights, preferences, and limitations, and
          other rights, preferences, and limitations as may be
          stated in the articles of incorporation or the bylaws.
          Each share shall be equal to every other share of the
          same class.</p>

          <p>(3) Each shareholder shall have 1 vote for each share
          of stock held by that shareholder on each matter
          submitted to a vote of shareholders, unless the articles
          or bylaws provide that each shareholder shall have 1 vote
          regardless of shares held by that shareholder or unless
          the articles or bylaws deny, limit, or otherwise
          prescribe the voting rights of shares of any class. The
          shareholders and each affected class of shareholders, if
          any, shall adopt, amend, or repeal any bylaw denying,
          limiting, or otherwise prescribing the voting rights of
          shareholders or any class of shareholders.</p>

          <p>(4) Except as otherwise provided by the articles or
          bylaws, shares of stock shall not be transferable and
          shall be canceled upon the death or resignation of the
          owner of the shares.</p>

          <p>(5) A corporation may adopt rules of qualification and
          government of its shareholders pursuant to its articles
          and bylaws. Adopted rules shall be reasonable, germane to
          the purposes of the corporation, and equally enforced as
          to all shareholders. A corporation may provide for the
          cancellation of the stock of a shareholder who fails to
          comply with adopted rules without liability for an
          accounting.</p>

          <p>(7) A corporation may adopt rules of qualification and

          organized upon a membership basis may provide that
          membership shall be limited to persons who are members in
          good standing in other corporations. The articles of
          incorporation may provide that failure to remain a member
          in good standing in the other corporation constitutes
          grounds for expulsion of a member if the bylaws of the

          subscription agreement, including an amount which may

          rights and duties: (a) It may collect the amount due in
          the same manner as any other debt owing to it.</p>

          <p>(b) If the articles of incorporation or bylaws of a
          corporation organized upon a stock basis permit the
          transfer of shares, it may sell the shares in any
          reasonable manner consistent therewith at any time before
          full satisfaction of the claim or a judgment therefor.
          Notice of the time and place of a public sale or of the
          time after which a private sale may be had, together with
          a statement of the amount due upon each share, shall be
          given in writing to the subscriber personally or by
          registered or certified mail at least 20 days before any
          such time stated in the notice. Any excess of net
          proceeds realized over the amount due plus interest shall
          be paid to the subscriber. If the sale is made in good
          faith, in a reasonable manner, and upon such notice, the
          corporation may recover the difference between the amount
          due plus interest and the net proceeds of the sale. A
          good faith purchaser for value acquires title to the sold
          shares free of any right of the subscriber even though
          the corporation fails to comply with 1 or more of the
          requirements of this subdivision.</p>

          <p>(c) It may rescind the subscription, with the effect
          provided in section 310, and may recover damages for
          breach of contract. In the case of transferable shares of
          a corporation organized upon a stock basis, unless
          special circumstances show proximate damages of a
          different amount, the measure of damages shall be the
          difference between the market price at the time and place
          of tender of the shares and the unpaid contract price.
          Liquidated damages may be provided for in the
          subscription agreement in any amount which is reasonable,
          including the difficulties of proof of loss. The
          subscriber may have restitution of the amount by which
          the sum of payments exceeds the corporation's damages for
          breach of contract, whether fixed by agreement or
          judgment.</p>

          <p>(2) The rights and duties set forth in this section
          shall be interpreted as cumulative so far as is
          consistent with entitling the corporation to a full and
          single recovery of the amount due or its damages. The
          subscription agreement may limit the rights and remedies
          of the corporation set forth in this section, and may add
          to them so far as is consistent with this subsection.</p>

          classes of directors, the term of office of directors in
          the first class shall expire at the first annual meeting

          entire board may be removed: (a) With or without cause,
          by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares or by

          directors then in office in the case of a corporation
          organized upon a directorship basis.</p>

          <p>(2) In the case of a corporation having cumulative
          voting, if less than the entire board is to be removed,
          no 1 of the directors may be removed if the votes cast
          against the director's removal would be sufficient to
          elect the director if then cumulatively voted at an
          election of the entire board of directors, or, if there
          are classes of directors, at an election of the class of
          directors of which the director is a part.</p>

          applies, with respect to removal of a director so

          <p>Sec. 562. Unless otherwise provided by law or its
          articles of incorporation or bylaws, a corporation has
          the power to indemnify a person who was or is a party to
          or is threatened to be made a party to a threatened,
          pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right
          of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by
          reason of the fact that the person is or was a director,
          officer, employee, nondirector volunteer, or agent of the
          corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
          corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee,
          employee, nondirector volunteer, or agent of another
          foreign or domestic corporation, business corporation,
          partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise
          whether for profit or not against expenses, including
          actual and reasonable attorneys' fees, and amounts paid
          in settlement incurred by the person in connection with
          the action or suit if the person acted in good faith and
          in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or
          not opposed to the best interests of the corporation or
          its shareholders or members. However, indemnification
          shall not be made for a claim, issue, or matter in which
          the person has been found liable to the corporation
          unless and only to the extent that the court in which the
          action or suit was brought has determined upon
          application that, despite the adjudication of liability
          but in view of all circumstances of the case, the person
          is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for
          expenses which the court considers proper.</p>

          to present their claims in writing. The notice shall be

          date of the first publication of the notice and does not
          preclude the enforcement of a lien, encumbrance, or other
          security interest. A claim filed by a trustee or paying

          capital, deposits, and fees of members not claimed within
          5 years after reasonable notice has been given to the
          member's last known address shall remain the property of
          the corporation. If any such refund is not claimed by the
          member within the 5-year period, the member shall have no
          claim to the refund.</p>

          <p>(7) The articles or bylaws may provide that if within
          any time specified in the bylaws or articles any

          required for membership or has failed to comply with the
          provisions of the bylaws, if any, concerning admission to
          membership, any amounts allocated from net savings and
          credited to the member capital of the nonmember patron
