version 0.9.2 - Sep 21, 2005
 - Compatibility with Backtalk 1.4.

version 0.9.1 - Feb  2, 2005
  - Fix %s separator function to correctly report number of lines in responses.
  - Fix %(V and %(W item functions to work correctly in isep when item text
    is hidden/erased.
  - In source files, lines starting with #ft# are not comments.  This is
    so we can put Fronttalk-only commands in source files shared with Picospan
    or Yapp.
  - Implemented "set password".  If connected to a remote server, this
    changes the remote password.  If direct connected, it just runs !passwd.
  - The default iseps and rseps say "hidden" instead of "censored" and
    "erased" instead of "censored & scribbled".
  - Implemented "who" and "write" commands, though only for local server.
  - Login message and "display thishost" tell you whether your net connection
    is secure (that is, https) or not.
  - "change name" command checks if you are logged in first.
  - Various cleanup of help pages.
  - Fix improper resetting of signal handlers after readline.

version 0.9.0 - Jan 31, 2005
  - Support for accessing and running servers using the "https" protocol.
  - Substantial rewrite of define handling code, to bring undefine and
    conference rc file handling into compliance with Picospan.
  - Make "define name" print the current value of a define, instead of
    undefining it.  This is a deviation from Picospan, but a good one.
  - Can now set environment variables with "define whatever 256 value".
  - Can put multiple commands on a line, separating them with semicolons.
  - "Enter" and "echo" commands work at rfp prompt.
  - Support skip/noskip options on "read new" commands.  Noskip forces rfp
    prompt from "read new" even for items with no new responses.  Default is
    "skip" unless an item range is given with only one item, in which case
    default is "noskip".
  - Re-execute bbs/rc and .cfonce files after successful "server" command.
  - Re-execute bbs/rc, .cfonce, conf/rc and .cfrc files after successful
    "login" command.
  - Fix "." in item ranges to correctly refer to last item viewed.
  - Fix problems with "set sane" and "set supersane" terminating execution
    of .cfonce files.
  - "set supersane" no longer resets the value of the "nosource" flag.
  - When entering or responding, check that user is logged in before asking
    them to type in text.
  - Fixed "display modestay" command.
  - Implemented "set default" command for Picospan compatiblity.
  - Implemented "source" command.
  - Implemented "leave" command.
  - Implemented "resign" and "set resign" commands.
  - Implemented "set chat".
  - "set allowed" is an alias for "set ulist".

  - Don't print "slipped" in message if we saw later responses on
    "again" commands.
  - Connect messages includes connection type (direct vs. network).

    to display server info.
