        SET LOGIN

Display/Edit the login file for the current conference.  This file is
printed as a banner message whenever a user joins the conference.  Typically
it contains the name of the conference, the names of the fairwitnesses, and
maybe some minimal ascii art.  You need to be a fairwitness to be able to
set the login screen.
