                       Fronttalk Command:  FIND

Usage:  FIND "pattern" (login) <item range>

Search items in the current conference.  The item range is used to select
a subset of the conferences to search.  The default is ALL at the Ok
prompt, or just the current item at the "Respond or pass" prompt.  For a
full description of item ranges, do "HELP RANGE".

Quoted and parenthesized strings have a different meaning for FIND than
the do for other commmands.  Quoted strings are a pattern to search the
items for.  Parenthesized strings restrict the search to items and responses
by that author.

Here are some common examples:

   FIND "potatos"         - Find all mentions of the word "potatos"
   FIND "cats" 1-3        - Find all mentions of cats in items 1 through 3
   FIND "peas" (joe,mike) - Find all places where joe or mike mentioned "peas"
   FIND (harry)           - Find all items and responses posted by harry

The formatting of the Find output is controlled by the FSEP and FTSEP defines.
See "HELP DEFINE FSEP" for more information.
