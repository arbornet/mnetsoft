           Fronttalk Defines: PROMPT, NOCONFP, RFPPROMPT, OBVPROMPT

Usage:  DEFINE PROMPT "\nOk: "
	DEFINE NOCONFP "\n(no conf): "
        DEFINE RFPPROMPT "\nRespond or pass? "
        DEFINE OBVPROMPT "\nResponse not possible.  Pass? "

These DEFINE commands configure the prompts used in various places in
Fronttalk.  The default values are as shown above.

The first two are are "Ok" prompts, used for top-level command input.  The
NOCONFP version is used if you are not in a conference, an situation not
yet supported by Fronttalk, so it never occurs.

The second two are "Respond or Pass? " prompts, printed after each item when
doing a READ.  The OBVPROMPT is used for frozen or retired items, or if the
user is not logged in and thus cannot post.
