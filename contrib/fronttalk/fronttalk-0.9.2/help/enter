                       Fronttalk Command:  ENTER

Usage:  ENTER                                         ("Ok:" prompt only)

Enter a new item into the currently selected conference.  You will first
be prompted for the text of the item, and then for a short header.

Text entry is usually done by the 'gate' text gatherer.  If this is being
used, then the following commands will work if typed at the begining of a
line during text entry:

  :          Start up your default editor on the text.
  :q         Cancel text entry.
  :p         Print what you've typed so far.
  :spell     Run spell checker on text.
  :r <file>  Read a file into your text.
  :help      Print help.
  :clear     Erase text entered so far.

The normal way to terminate entry of text is to type a dot (.) or a control-D
at the beginning of a line.

After you have entered the text, you will be prompted for a short subject
line, which will be displayed in the header of the new item.

Only the conference fairwitness can enter the first item in a conference.
