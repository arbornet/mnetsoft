                       Fronttalk Command:  NEW

Usage: NEW                                  ("Respond or Pass?" prompt only)
       NEW <response number>

Stop reading items, just like QUIT, but do not mark the responses just
displayed as "seen".  If no response number is given, then the item will
be left as it was, so you will see the same responses again next time you do
"READ NEW".  If a response number is given, that that response and all
subsequent responses will be "new" the next time you read the conference, but
all previous responses will not be new.

The HOLD command also leaves responses marked unread, but goes on to read
the next item instead of exiting to the "Ok:" prompt.
