                       Fronttalk Command:  DISFAVOR

Usage:  DISFAVOR <item range>

Mark all selected items as non-favorites.  Favorite items are listed first
when you "BROWSE" or "READ" items in the conference.

The "favorite" flag is set with the "FAVOR" command, or it may be
automatically set when you post or respond to items.

For a full description of item ranges, do "HELP RANGE".  Here are some
common examples:

   DISFAVOR 13      - Disfavor item 13.
   DISFAVOR "Bush"  - Disfavor all items with the word "Bush" in their titles.

If you just say "DISFAVOR" the default is to favor the current item.

In addition to the flags described in "HELP RANGE" you can also give the
CONFIRM flag on the command line.  Then each selected item's header will
be printed, and you will be asked if you want to disfavor it.
