                       Fronttalk Command:  WRITE

Usage:  WRITE
        CHAT

Talk to another user on the local server.  This is just an alias for the
Unix "write" command included for Picospan compatibility.

The SET WRITE and SET NOWRITE control whether other users can write to you.
Of course, those are just aliases for the Unix "mesg y" and "mesg n" commands.
