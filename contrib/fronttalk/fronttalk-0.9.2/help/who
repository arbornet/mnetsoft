                       Fronttalk Command:  WHO

Usage:  WHO

Display a list of users logged on to the local server.  It would be nice
if there were a way to display lists of users connected to the remote server,
but there isn't.  This is just an alias for the Unix "who" command included
for Picospan compatibility.
