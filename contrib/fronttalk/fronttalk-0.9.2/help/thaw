                       Fronttalk Command:  THAW

Usage:  THAW <item range>

Mark all selected items not frozen, so that people can once again post
responses to it.  Fairwitnesses can thaw frozen items in their conferences.
Depending on the Backtalk server configuration, the original author of an
item may also be able to thaw it.

For a full description of item ranges, do "HELP RANGE".  If you just say
"THAW" without arguments the current item will be thawed.

In addition to the flags described in "HELP RANGE" you can also give the
CONFIRM flag on the command line.  Then each selected item's header will
be printed, and you will be asked if you want to thaw it.
