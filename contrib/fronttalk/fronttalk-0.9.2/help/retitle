                       Fronttalk Command:  RETITLE

Usage:  RETITLE <item number>
        RETITLE <item number> "<title>"
	RETITLE
	RETITLE "<title>"

Change the title of an item.  If entered at the "Respond or pass?" prompt,
then the item number can be omitted.  If the new title is not given on the
command line, you will be prompted for it.

Who can retitle items depends on the server configuration.  The conference
fairwitness and the item author may each be able to do so.

Note that it is also possible to set private titles, seen only by the user
who sets them.  Anyone can set a private title on any item.  See the MYTITLE
command.
