                       Fronttalk Command:  JOIN

Usage:  JOIN <conference>                             ("Ok:" prompt only)
        JOIN <server>:<conference>

Select a different conference to read or post too.  For a list of all the
conferences available on the current server, do "DISPLAY CONFERENCES".

Not all conferences are accessible to all users.  Some are closed to all
users not on a list maintained by the fairwitness.  Some can be read by
all users, but can only be posted to by users on a list.

You can select a conference on a different Backtalk server by using the
second form of the command, with the server name prefixing the conference
name.  The "DISPLAY SERVERS" command lists all servers known to Fronttalk.

If a server name is given, but no conference name, (eg "JOIN grex:") then
you will join the default conference on that server.  This is equivalent
the the SERVER command.
