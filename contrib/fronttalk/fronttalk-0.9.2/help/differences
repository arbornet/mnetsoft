		Difference between Fronttalk and Picospan

This help topic summarizes differences between Fronttalk and Picospan.  They
are similar enough that Picospan users will find most things work the same,
but Fronttalk does not attempt to clone Picospan exactly.  Major differences
are listed below.

Fronttalk extensions:
---------------------

 * On the Fronttalk command line or on the JOIN command you can give a
   conference name like "hvcn:design" or "grex:agora" to indicate that
   you want to join the given conference on the given system.

 * If you attempt to connect to a remote system, you will generally be
   asked for a login and password.  If the server supports anonymous
   reading, you have the option of not logging in.

 * The Fronttalk SERVER command connects you to a different Backtalk server.
   "DISPLAY SERVERS" gives a list of servers known to Fronttalk.  "DISPLAY
   THISSERVER" gives information about the current server.

 * In Fronttalk, you can use the FAVOR command to mark items as favorites,
   and these will be shown before other items, unless you read or browse
   with the NOFAVFIRST flag.  There is also a DISFAVOR command.

 * Fronttalk can retitle an item with the RETITLE command, which can be issued
   either at the OK prompt or the "Respond or pass" prompt.

 * Fronttalk users can set a private title on any item using the MYTITLE
   command.

 * In Fronttalk, if you connected to a system in anonymous reading mode,
   without logging in, you can login later with the LOGIN command.

 * Fronttalk uses "readline" to read commands.  This enables editing the
   command line and accessing the command history with your arrow keys.

 * The Fronttalk NEW and POSTPONE commands take an optional argument.  If
   given, this is the response number which will be the first new response
   the next time you read the item.  Fronttalk adds HOLD as a synonym for 
   POSTPONE.

 * Fronttalk adds an UNEXPURGATE command.  HIDE is a synonym for EXPURGATE.
   SHOW is a synonym for UNHIDE.  ERASE is a synonym for SCRIBBLE.

 * In Fronttalk, FORGET, REMEMBER, FREEZE, THAW, RETIRE, UNRETIRE, and KILL
   can be given with arguments at the "Respond or Pass" prompt, just as they
   can be at the OK prompt.  Without an argument they default to the current
   item, of course.

 * In Fronttalk, FORGET, REMEMBER, FREEZE, THAW, RETIRE, UNRETIRE, LINK, FIX,
   and KILL can be given CONFIRM or NOCONFIRM flags.  If CONFIRM is set, each
   selected item's header will be printed, and you'll be asked if you want
   to operate on that item.  Confirm defaults on for the KILL command and
   off for the rest.

 * The FIND command also searchs text of item titles and can search for
   responses by particular authors.

 * In Fronttalk, item ranges on commands like READ, BROWSE, or FORGET can
   include arguments like (joe,sue,fred) to select only items authored by
   the listed users.

Features implemented differently in Fronttalk:
----------------------------------------------
 * In Fronttalk, the NOFORGET flag doesn't make hidden responses visible, it
   only makes retired and forgotten items visible.  Instead there is a
   separate "SET NOHIDE" switch that makes hidden responses visible.  Also,
   in Fronttalk, doing "ONLY 12" will display the text of response 12 even
   if it is hidden.

 * When the Fronttalk NEXT command hits the end of the conference list, it
   does an automatic REWIND.

 * In Picospan, the SET STAY flag effects all commands RESPOND, FORGET,
   REMEMBER, FREEZE, THAW, RETIRE, and UNRETIRE.  In Fronttalk it effects
   only the RESPOND command.  The SET MODESTAY flag effects the others and
   defaults on instead of off.

 * The Picospan "DISPLAY CONFERENCE" command is not supported in Fronttalk.
   Use "DISPLAY THISCONFERENCE" instead.  In Fronttalk, "DISPLAY CONFERENCES"
   is a synonym for Picospan's "HELP CONFERENCES".

 * Fronttalk's parsing of dates in commands like "READ SINCE Jan 31"  is
   different than Picospan.  It mostly accepts a broader range of date
   syntax, but it may interpret some dates slightly differently.  In
   particular "-1" means 24 hours ago, not the begining of yesterday.

 * In Picospan the command "DEFINE name" counterintuitively undefines
   the named object.  In Fronttalk it just prints the current definition,
   if any.

 * Separator syntax differs to some degree.  There are a number of Picospan
   separators that Fronttalk doesn't implement, and there are a few additions
   to the separators.  Some of the default separators are different as well.

Picospan features not available in Fronttalk:
---------------------------------------------

 * Fronttalk does not yet allow you to join conferences as an observer.
   The SET RESIGN command does not put you into observer mode (though it
   does delete your participation file) and the SET JOIN command does not
   exist.  You are not asked if you want to join or observe when joining
   a conference for the first time.

 * Fronttalk does not do party (synchronous) items or clusters.

 * You cannot SET PASSWORD from Fronttalk.

 * Commands like MAIL, CHAT, and WHO, which are just wrappers around Unix
   commands are not included in Fronttalk.  They could be created as
   aliases, but then they would run on the local machine, not the remote
   machine.

 * Fronttalk always operates in AUTOSAVE mode and will probably never
   support NOAUTOSAVE MODE.  Thus SET AUTOSAVE is ignored and SET RELOAD,
   SET SAVESEEN and SET NOAUTOSAVE are rejected.

 * Fronttalk does not have a built-in text entry system.  An external program
   like "gate" must be used.  Because of this, the EDALWAYS flag is always on.
