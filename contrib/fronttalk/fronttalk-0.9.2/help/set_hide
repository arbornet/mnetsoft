                       Fronttalk Setting:  HIDE

Usage:  SET HIDE
        SET NOHIDE

The HIDE flag controls whether or not the text of hidden responses are
displayed when you do a READ.

By default HIDE is set, so that hidden responses will not be shown.  If
you set NOHIDE, they will be shown.

You can see an individual hidden response without setting the NOHIDE flag
by doing 'ONLY <response number>'.
