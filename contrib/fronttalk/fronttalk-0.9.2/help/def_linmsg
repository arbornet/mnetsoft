                        Fronttalk Defines:  LINMSG

Usage:  DEFINE LINMSG "<string>"

The LINMSG define is a conference separator displayed when a user 
JOINs a conference.  It can also be run by the "DISPLAY LOGIN" and
"DISPLAY NEW" commands.  It displays various introductory information.

For full details on its format, see help pages on SEPARATORS, CONFFUNC,
CONFCOND, and SEPDATE.

The default value is:

  "%(1x%(2x\n%)%0g%)\
   %(2x%(3N%3g%)\
   (%1x\n%)\
   %(n%(r%r newresponse item%S%)\
   %(b%(r and %)%b brandnew item%S%)\n%)\
   %(iFirst item %f, last %l\n%)\
   %(sYou are a fair-witness in this conference.\n%)\
   %(lYou are an observer of this conference.\n%)\
   %(jYour name is \"%u\" in this conference.\n\
   %(~O%(4F\n%4g%E\n>>>> New users: type HELP for help.\n%)%)%)%)%c"

The first line displays the login file.  Because of the "%(1x" things, this
is show by JOIN and "DISPLAY LOGIN", but not "DISPLAY NEW".  The rest is
shown by JOIN and "DISPLAY NEW", but not "DISPLAY LOGIN".

The second line displays the bulletin file if it has changed since the last
time the user logged in.  The third line is just a blank line.

The fourth and fifth line display the number of newresponse and brandnew
items in the conferences, and the sixth displays the range of item numbers.

The seventh and eighth lines remind the user that he is a fair-witness or
an observer.

The ninth line tells people joining for the first time what their name has
defaulted to in this conference.  If they are not observers, the tenth line
prints a welcome message - either the contents of the welcome file, if it
exists, or a short directive to type HELP for help.
