                       Fronttalk Setting:  DEFAULT

Usage:  SET DEFAULT
        SET NODEFAULT

If this is set in the system RC file or in a user's .cfonce file, then
when Fronttalk is joined, no conference will be joined initially.  You
start out in "no conf" mode.  From there you can join a conference with
the JOIN command.  I can't imagine why you'd want to do this.  It's here
for Picospan compatiblity.
