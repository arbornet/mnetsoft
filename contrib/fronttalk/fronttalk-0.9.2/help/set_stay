                       Fronttalk Setting:  STAY

Usage:  SET STAY
        SET NOSTAY

If the STAY flag is set, then you will be returned to the "Respond or Pass"
prompt for the same item after you respond to the item.  This is handy if
you like entering multiple responses in a row and such.

If NOSTAY is set, then an automatic PASS is executed after entering a response
so that you move on to the next item.  This is the default.

This setting effects only the RESPOND command.  To control whether you move
on to the next item after doing a FORGET or FAVOR, see SET MODESTAY
