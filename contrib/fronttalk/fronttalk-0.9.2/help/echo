             Fronttalk Commands:  ECHO, ECHOE, ECHOEN, ECHON

Usage:  ECHO <message>                                  ("Ok:" prompt only)
        ECHOE <message>
        ECHOEN <message>
        ECHON <message>

These commands just print their arguments.  They are usually used in various
startup script files, like .cfrc and .cfonce.

The ECHO command prints the message to standard output, with a terminating
newline.  ECHOE and ECHOEN print their output to standard error instead of
standard output.  ECHOEN and ECHON omit the terminating newline.
