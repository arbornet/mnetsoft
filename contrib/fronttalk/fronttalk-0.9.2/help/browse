                       Fronttalk Command:  BROWSE

Usage:  BROWSE <item range>                             ("Ok:" prompt only)

List all items in the given range.

For a full description of item ranges, do "HELP RANGE".  Here are some
common examples:

   BROWSE ALL        - All items not forgotten
   BROWSE NEW        - Items with new responses.
   BROWSE (joe)      - Items entered by login ID joe.
   BROWSE "apples"   - Items with the word "apples" in the title.
   BROWSE 14,22-31   - Item 14, and items 22 through 31.

If you just say "BROWSE" the default is to do "BROWSE NEW".

In addition to the flags described in "HELP RANGE" there are some additional
flags that work only on the BROWSE command:

   LONG     - Choose long format - the same as the item headers shown by READ
   SHORT    - Choose short format - tabular with response counts.

The default format is installation dependent.  The actual appearance of
these formats depends on how the separators are defined (see "HELP ISEP"
and "HELP ISHORT").  The output will be filtered through a pager (see
"HELP PAGER").  The usual pager is "more" which will pause the display after
each full screen.  Hit <space> to see the next screen.
