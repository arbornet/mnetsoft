                     Fronttalk Defines:  ZSEP

Usage:  DEFINE ZSEP "<string>"

The ZSEP define is an item separator displayed during READ commands after
each item.

For full details on its format, see help pages on SEPARATORS, ITEMFUNC,
ITEMCOND, and SEPDATE.

The default value is:

  "%(T\f%)%c"

This displays a formfeed if the FF flag was given on the READ command,
but otherwise does nothing.
