                       Fronttalk Setting:  MODESTAY

Usage:  SET MODESTAY
        SET NOMODESTAY

The MODESTAY flag is similar to the STAY flag, in that it effects what happens
after you execute commands at the "Respond or Pass?" prompt.  Do you stay at
the same item, or pass on to the next item?

The STAY flag, however, effects only what happens after the RESPOND command,
while MODESTAY effects what happens after FORGET, REMEMBER, RETIRE, UNRETIRE,
FREEZE, THAW, MARK SEEN, FAVOR and DISFAVOR.  The MODESTAY flag defaults on.
