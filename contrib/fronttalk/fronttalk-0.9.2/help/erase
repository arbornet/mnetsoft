                       Fronttalk Command:  ERASE

Usage: ERASE <response number>               ("Respond or Pass?" prompt only)

Erase the given response number in the item currently being read.

Who can erase responses depends on the server configuration.  Usually the
author of the response may have this power, and the fairwitness of the
conference may have this power.

Erased response are actually deleted from the underlaying file, with their
content overwritten, so an erase command is generally irreversable.  However
many servers may log a copy of erased responses.
