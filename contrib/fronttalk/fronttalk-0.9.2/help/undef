                       Fronttalk Command:  UNDEF

Usage:  UNDEFINE
        UNDEFINE <name>...
        UNDEFINE <mask>

The UNDEF command is used to undefine variables and macros set by DEFINE.
Note that undefining a variables or macros with compiled in default values
simply reverts them to their defaults.  Undefining variables that were
created by by some previous "define" command and have no hardwired default
values causes them to disappear entirely.

UNDEF without arguments undefines everything.

UNDEF with one or more names undefines those values.

UNDEF with a mask value undefines everything that has a mask value that
intersects the given mask.

Conference rc scripts are forbidden to undefine any variables.
