Join the next conference in your hotlist that has items with new responses.
This is an easy way to cycle through all your favorite conferences.

To rewind back to the first conference, you can use the REWIND command.  A
rewind is automatically executed when you hit the end of your hotlist.

Currently there is a different hotlist on each server, stored in a file
named .cflist.  You can use the "CHANGE LIST" command to edit it.

In the future there will be a local conference hotlist that can span multiple
servers.
