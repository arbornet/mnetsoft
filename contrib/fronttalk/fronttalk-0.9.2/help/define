                       Fronttalk Command:  DEFINE

Usage:  DEFINE
        DEFINE <name>
        DEFINE <name> "<string>"
	DEFINE <name> <mask> "<string>"

The DEFINE command is used to define variables and macros that effect the
behavior of Fronttalk.

DEFINE without arguments lists all current definitions.

DEFINE with just a <name> argument prints the current definition of that
named object.  (Note that in Picospan this *undefines* it.  In Fronttalk
the UNDEF command does that.)

The other syntaxs assign a new value to a variable or macro.  The string can
contain the usual backslashed codes, like '\n' for newline.  The mask value
determines how the define will be used.  It can be a sum of the following:

      1 - OK prompt command macro
      2 - variable
      4 - command parameter (item-range, etc)
      8 - "Respond or Pass" macro
    256 - environment variable

If no mask value is given, 2 is assumed.  The name of a thing being defined
(especially of types 1, 4, and 8) can include one underscore ('_') to indicate
the minimum abbreviation.  Thus if we do:

   DEFINE u_sers 9 "unix 'who'"

then typing "u" or "us" or "use" or "user" or "users" at either the OK or
the "Respond or Pass" prompt causes the Unix 'who' command to be executed.

Some variables are used by Fronttalk for various things.  For more information
on these see "HELP DEFINE <variable>".  The following variables give strings
used for prompts in various places:

    PROMPT     - The "Ok" prompt.
    RFPPROMPT  - The "Respond or pass" prompt.
    OBVPROMPT  - Alternate "Respond or pass" prompt for frozen items.

The folowing variables give names of Unix programs to use for different
things:

    EDITOR     - The program used for text entry.  Usually 'gate'.
    PAGER      - The program used for output filtering.  Usually 'more'.

Then there are a large number of "separator" strings that specify the
format for different kinds of output.  For more information on the
syntax of these strings, see "HELP SEPARATORS":

    BULLMSG    - Format for displaying bulletin.
    CHECKMSG   - Format for CHECK command output.
    CONFMSG    - Format for "DISPLAY THISCONFERENCE" command.
    INDXMSG    - Format for displaying index file.
    LINMSG     - Format for "login" message printed when entering a conference.
    LOUTMSG    - Format for "logout" message printed when leaving a confernce.
    PARTMSG    - Format for PARTICIPANTS command output.
    PRINTMSG   - Format for title line for PRINT command output.

These separators are all for the display of items:

    ISEP       - Format for item headers in READ and "BROWSE LONG".
    ISHORT     - Format for item information in "BROWSE SHORT".
    FSEP       - Format for FIND command output.
    FTSEP      - Format for FIND command output.
    RSEP       - Format for response headers in READ.
    NSEP       - Format for response count, displayed after item text in READ.
    TXTSEP     - Format for response text in READ.
    ZSEP       - Format for end of responses in READ.

Conference rc files may use the define command to create new variables or
macros, or to change a compiled-in default value, but they cannot change
a value set by a previous define command.
