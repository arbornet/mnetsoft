                      Fronttalk Commands:  DATE, CDATE

Usage:  DATE <date>
        CDATE <date>

These commands parse and display a date.  DATE prints the full date, and
CDATE prints the internal hexidecimal representation of the date.  These
commands are really only useful for testing, but dates in the same format
are frequently used in command like "READ SINCE December 31" (see "HELP
RANGE").

Legal Date Formats:
-------------------

Dates can include many components, including months, dates, years, weekdays,
hours, minutes, and seconds.  These components can usually be entered in
any order.  They can be relative or absolute.

Examples of dates that can be used include:

   December 11, 1998
   12/11/1998
   11-Dec-98
   12.11.1998
   12-11
   Dec 11
   December
   Friday
   today
   yesterday

Note that dates are always interpreted American style, with month preceeding
years.  "25.12.1998" is an error, not Christmas.

You can also specify times:

   15:25
   3:25 pm
   3pm
   4:03:12 am
   12 noon
   12 midnight

You can combine dates and times:

   December 11 1998 7:30 am
   1pm yesterday
   Wednesday 3:34pm

By default, if a date could be either in the future or the past,
(e.g. "Wednesday") then it is normally interpreted as being in the past.
You can make this explicit with syntaxes like:

   next December
   last Wednesday

If the time specified refers to an period of time, (e.g. "2003"), by
default we take it to mean the beginning of that period.  This too can
be made explicit:

   start of next December
   end of 3/31
   beginning of time
   end of time.

It is frequently useful to specify dates relatively instead of absolutely.
The following three relative dates are equivalent:

   -2
   -2 days
   2 days ago

Other examples of relative dates include:

   4 hours ago
   3 weeks hence
   -1 day, 2 hours
   +4 days
   +4

Fronttalk trys hard to figure out what parts of a command are meant to be
part of the date, but in cases like:
   READ SINCE 3pm 1-12
it can be hard to tell if that means "read all responses entered since 3pm
on January 12" or "read responses entered after 3pm today to items one through
twelve".  In cases like this date arguments should be quoted like:
   READ SINCE "3pm 1-12"
but usually it is not necessary to quote date strings.
