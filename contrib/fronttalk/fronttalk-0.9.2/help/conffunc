                          Fronttalk Separators:
                 Functions Used in Conference Separators

For general information about separators see "HELP SEP".  This page just
describes the function codes that can be used in conference separators:

   %y    - number of unseen items.
   %b    - number of brandnew items.
   %r    - number of newresponse items.
   %n    - number of brandnew or newresponse items.
   %u    - user's full name in current conference.
   %v    - user's login id.
   %f    - number of first item.
   %l    - number of last item.
   %i    - number of items in current conference.
   %s    - full conference name.
   %q    - name conference was joined under.
   %t    - numeric conference type code.
   %D    - text conference type description.
   %h    - short server name.
   %H    - full server name.
   %k    - total number.  See "HELP PARTMSG".

The following functions return a date and time.  If a <count> is given,
like '%3o', then it controls the format.  See "HELP DATESEP":

   %o    - date/time user was last in this conference.
   %N    - current time.

The following functions return the content of one of the conference files:

   %0g   - login file
   %1g   - logout file
   %2g   - index file
   %3g   - bull file
   %4g   - welcome file
   %5g   - conference rc file
   %6g   - ulist file
   %7g   - glist file

The following Picospan separators are NOT implemented in Fronttalk:

   %d    - full path name of conference directory.
   %w    - user's working directory.
   %Q    - fail with a "Not in a conference!" message if not in a conference.
