Usage:  DISPLAY CFRC
        SET CFRC

Display/change your remote .cfrc file on the current server.   This is a
file that contains Fronttalk commands to execute every time you join a
conference, after the conference RC file is executed.

There can also be a .cfrc file in your home directory (or in a subdirectory
of your home directory named .cfdir) on your local system.  To view or edit
this, just use unix commands.
