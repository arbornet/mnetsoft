	   Introduction to "Respond or Pass" Prompt Commands

To get help on a specific topic type "HELP <topicname>".  For a complete
list of commands and topics, type "HELP TOPICS".

Most of the commands listed here can be abbreviated.  For example "r" instead
of "RESPONSE".

The "Respond or Pass" prompt is displayed after displaying an item.  The
most commonly used options are:

  RESPOND   - Post your own response to the end of the item.
  PSEUDONYM - Respond, using a pseudonym.
  PASS      - Don't respond.  Go on to the next item.
  <enter>   - Hitting enter without typing a command is the same as PASS.
  QUIT      - Stop reading items.  Return to OK prompt.
  NEW       - Quit, without marking the current item as having been read.
  POSTPONE  - Pass, without marking the current item as having been read.
  FORGET    - Mark item forgotten, so it won't be shown to you in the future.
  REMEMBER  - Unforget a forgotten item.

You can redisplay portions of the current item with the following commands:

  AGAIN     - Display the item again.
  12        - Redisplay the item starting with response 12.
  ONLY 12   - Redisplay response 12 only.
  0         - Redisplay the item starting with the item text.
  12-24     - Redisplay responses 12 through 24.
  12,24     - Redisplay responses 12 and 24
  HEAD      - Redisplay the item header.

If you are the author of an item, or a fairwitness in the conference, you
may be able to use some of the following commands:

  FREEZE    - Prevent any further responses from being posted to this item.
  THAW      - Unfreeze the item.
  RETIRE    - Don't show this item to anyone (unless they "READ NOFORGET").
  UNRETIRE  - Unretire the item.
  RETITLE   - Change the title on this item.
  KILL      - Delete this item.
