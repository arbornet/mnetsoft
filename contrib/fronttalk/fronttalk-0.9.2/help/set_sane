                    Fronttalk Settings:  SANE, SUPERSANE

Usage:  SET SANE
        SET SUPERSANE

Setting SANE causes all settings and defines changed by the conference RC
file or the user's .cfrc file to be undone.  Putting a SET SANE in the
begining of your .cfrc file ensures that no conference RC file settings
will effect you (since .cfrc is executed after the conference RC file),
however putting SET NOSOURCE in your .cfonce is generally a better way to
achieve this effect.  Putting SET SANE in a .cfonce file is useless,
because .cfonce is executed before the conference RC file or the .cfrc file.

Setting SUPERSANE resets all settings made from the system RC file, the
.cfonce file and the command line to the compiled in defaults.  The sole
exception is that it does not reset the SOURCE setting.  Users who don't
want the settings and defines in the system RC file can place at the front
of their .cfonce files.

These switches reset past settings and defines.  They do not prevent more
things from being defined in the future.  To prevent conference RC files
from being executed in the future, use the SET NOSOURCE command.
