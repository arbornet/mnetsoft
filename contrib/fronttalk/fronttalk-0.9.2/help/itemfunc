                          Fronttalk Separators:
                   Functions Used in Item Separators

For general information about separators see "HELP SEP".  This page just
describes the function codes that can be used in item separators:

   %i    - item number.
   %h    - item title.
   %a    - full name of author.
   %l    - login name of author.
   %u    - uid number of author.
   %n    - number of responses to item.
   %r    - current response number.
   %s    - number of lines in current response.
   %q    - number of charaters in current response.
   %k    - number of charaters in current response / 1024.
   %L    - text of current response line.  (TXTSEP, FSEP only)
   %N    - current response line number.   (TXTSEP, FSEP only)

The following functions return dates and times.  If a <count> is given,
like '%3t', then it controls the format.  See "HELP DATESEP":

   %t    - date/time of item or response (default format is 0).
   %d    - date/time of item or response (default format is 1).

The following Picospan item separator functions are NOT IMPLEMENTED in
Fronttalk:

   %Q    - number of charaters in current item.
   %K    - number of charaters in current item / 1024.
