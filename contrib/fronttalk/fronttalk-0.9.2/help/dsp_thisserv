                   Fronttalk Display Value:  THISSERVER

Usage:  DISPLAY THISSERVER

Display information about the current server.  This includes the name of
the server, the URLs of the server, its version number, the connection
and login methods being used, and whether anonymous reading is allowed.

The connection type tells if you are connecting to the server over the
network or by having the client directly execute the server program.
If you are connecting over the network, it may say the connection is
"insecure", which just means you are connecting using an unencrypted "http"
type protocol, instead of via an encrypted "https" protocol.

Synonyms:  DISPLAY THISSYSTEM, DISPLAY THISHOST
