                       Fronttalk Command:  FAVOR

Usage:  FAVOR <item range>

Mark all selected items as favorites.  Favorite items will be listed first
when you "BROWSE" or "READ" items in the conference.

If you want to remove the "favorite" flag from an item, use the DISFAVOR
command.

For a full description of item ranges, do "HELP RANGE".  Here are some
common examples:

   FAVOR 13         - Favor item 13.
   FAVOR (joe)      - Favor items entered by login ID joe.

If you just say "FAVOR" the default is to favor the current item.

In addition to the flags described in "HELP RANGE" you can also give the
CONFIRM flag on the command line.  Then each selected item's header will
be printed, and you will be asked if you want to favor it.
