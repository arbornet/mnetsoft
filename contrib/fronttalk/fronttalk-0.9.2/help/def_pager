                            Fronttalk Define:  PAGER

Usage:  DEFINE PAGER "more"

When ever multiple lines of text are displayed, Fronttalk will filter the
output through the program defined by the PAGER define.  This is almost
always "more" (or "less").

The pager can be something more complex.  For example, if you wanted
everything displayed in upper case you could do:

   define pager "tr a-z A-Z | more"
