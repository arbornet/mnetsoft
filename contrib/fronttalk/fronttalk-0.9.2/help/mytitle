                       Fronttalk Command:  MYTITLE

Usage:  MYTITLE <item number>
        MYTITLE <item number> "<title>"
	MYTITLE
	MYTITLE "<title>"

Set a private title for an item.  Private titles are seen only by the user
who sets them.

If entered at the "Respond or pass?" prompt, then the item number can be
omitted.  If the private title is not given on the command line, you will
be prompted for it.

To change the real title of an item, the one seen by all users, use the
RETITLE command.
