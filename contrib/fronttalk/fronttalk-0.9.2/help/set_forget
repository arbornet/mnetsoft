                       Fronttalk Setting:  FORGET

Usage:  SET FORGET
        SET NOFORGET

The FORGET flag controls whether or not forgotten and retired items are
included when you do a READ, BROWSE or FIND.  It does not effect commands
like FREEZE and REMEMBER.

By default FORGET is set, so that forgotten or retired items will not be
shown.  If you set NOFORGET, they will be shown.

Note that the FORGET flag does not effect the display of hidden responses,
as it does in Picospan.  The HIDE flag does this.  See "HELP SET HIDE".
