                       Fronttalk Setting:  READLINE

Usage:  SET READLINE
        SET NOREADLINE

"Readline" is a standard Unix package used by many shells to allow command
line editing.  When READLINE is turned on in Fronttalk, they you can use
the arrow keys and other control keys to edit commands you are typing,
our to go back (with the up-arrow key) and edit and re-enter previous
commands.

READLINE defaults on in Fronttalk, but if your system doesn't have any
Perl Term::ReadLine library installed, or if you turn it off, Fronttalk
still work, minus the command line editing capability.

The main reason for turning it off is that at least some versions of the
Perl::ReadLine modules seem to be rather flakey, and prone to causing
"Segmentation Fault" crashes.

There are two different modules around, and if your system has both installed,
you can select which one to use by setting the PERL_RL environment variable
to "Perl" (for Term::ReadLine::Perl) or "Gnu" (for Term::ReadLine::Gnu) before
running Fronttalk.

DISPLAY READLINE will tell you which ReadLine library Fronttalk is using.
