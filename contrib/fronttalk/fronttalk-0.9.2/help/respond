                       Fronttalk Command:  RESPOND

Usage: RESPOND                            ("Respond or Pass?" prompt only)

Enter a new response into the item currently begin read.  Use this if you
have something to say on the topic of the current item.  If you want to start
a new topic, use the ENTER command to start a new item instead.

Text entry is usually done by the 'gate' text gatherer.  If this is being
used, then the following commands will work if typed at the begining of a
line during text entry:

  :          Start up your default editor on the text.
  :q         Cancel text entry.
  :p         Print what you've typed so far.
  :spell     Run spell checker on text.
  :r <file>  Read a file into your text.
  :help      Print help.
  :clear     Erase text entered so far.

The normal way to terminate entry of text is to type a dot (.) or a control-D
at the beginning of a line.

You cannot respond to frozen items.

You will be warned if other responses were posted while you were composing
your response.
