                       Fronttalk Setting:  CFONCE

Usage:  DISPLAY CFONCE
        SET CFONCE

Display/change your remote .cfonce file on the current server.   This is a
file that contains Fronttalk commands to execute when you first connect to
the server.  Usually this consists mainly of DEFINE and SET commands.

There can also be a .cfonce file in your home directory (or in a subdirectory
of your home directory named .cfdir) on your local system.  To view or edit
this, just use unix commands.
