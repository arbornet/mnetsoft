                          Fronttalk Separators:
               Conditionals Used in Conference Separators

For general information about separators see "HELP SEP".  This page just
describes the conditional codes that can be used in conference separators:

   %(y   - true if there are unseen items.
   %(b   - true if there are brandnew items.
   %(r   - true if there are newresponse items.
   %(n   - true if there are brandnew or newresponse items.
   %(i   - true if there are any items.
   %(s   - true if you are a fairwitness in this conference.
   %(j   - true if you just joined the conference for the first time ever.
   %(l   - true if you are not logged in.

The following codes test for the existence and newness of various conference
files:

   %(0F  - true if login file exists.
   %(1F  - true if logout file exists.
   %(2F  - true if index file exists.
   %(3F  - true if bull file exists.
   %(4F  - true if welcome file exists.
   %(5F  - true if conference rc file exists.
   %(6F  - true if ulist file exists.
   %(7F  - true if glist file exists.

   %(0N  - true if login file was modified since user's last login.
   %(1N  - true if logout file was modified since user's last login.
   %(2N  - true if index file was modified since user's last login.
   %(3N  - true if bull file was modified since user's last login.
   %(4N  - true if welcome file was modified since user's last login.
   %(5N  - true if conference rc file was modified since user's last login.
   %(6N  - true if ulist file was modified since user's last login.
   %(7N  - true if glist file was modified since user's last login.

The following test has different meanings in different separators.  In the
LINMSG sep, which usually prints the login screen and the number of new
responses in the conference, it is used as follows:

   %(1x  - true if should print the login screen ("JOIN" or "DISP LOGIN").
   %(2x  - true if should print the new response count ("JOIN" or "DISP NEW").
   %(3x  - true if should print both ("JOIN").

In the PARTMSG sep, which has a header, multiple text lines, and a footer,
they are as follows:

   %(1x  - true if should print the header.
   %(2x  - true if should print a line of the body.
   %(4x  - true if should print the footer.

The following Picospan conditional have NOT been implemented in Fronttalk:

   %(m   - true if new mail has arrived.
   %(O   - true if you joined from another conferences.
   %(C   - true if you are in a conference.
   %(f   - true if the current conference has a summary file.
