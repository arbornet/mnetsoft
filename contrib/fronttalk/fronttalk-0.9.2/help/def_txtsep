                     Fronttalk Defines:  TXTSEP

Usage:  DEFINE TXTSEP "<string>"

The TXTSEP define is an item separator used to display each line of each
response during a READ.

For full details on its format, see help pages on SEPARATORS, ITEMFUNC,
ITEMCOND, and SEPDATE.

The default value is:

  "%(L%(F%7N:%)%X%L%)"

This prints a line number if the NUMBERED flag was given, one space, and
then the text of the line.
