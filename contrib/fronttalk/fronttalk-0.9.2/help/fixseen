                       Fronttalk Command:  FIXSEEN

Usage:  FIXSEEN <item range>

Mark all selected items as seen.  All currently existing responses will
be marked seen, so they will not appear in a future "READ NEW".

For a full description of item ranges, do "HELP RANGE".  Here are some
common examples:

   FIX  13         - Mark item 13 seen.
   FIX "blue"      - Mark items with the word "blue" in their titles seen.

If you just say "FIXSEEN" the default is to mark all items if you are at
the "Ok" prompt, or just the current item if you are at the "Respond or
pass" prompt.

In addition to the flags described in "HELP RANGE" you can also give the
CONFIRM flag on the command line.  Then each selected item's header will
be printed, and you will be asked if you want to mark it seen it.
