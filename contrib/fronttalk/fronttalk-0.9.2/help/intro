              Introduction to "OK" Prompt Commands

Welcome to Fronttalk - a Picospanish command-line interface to Backtalk.

To get help on a specific topic type "HELP <topicname>".  For a complete
list of commands and topics, type "HELP TOPICS".

For a list of Backtalk servers you can connect to, type "DISPLAY SERVERS".
To connect to a different server, use the "SERVER" command.

For a list of all available conferences on the current server, type
"DISPLAY CONFERENCES".  To select a conference use the "JOIN" command.

To read all new items and responses the current conference, type "READ NEW".
To keep things simple on your first visit just a few items will initialy
be considered "new".  Others will become "new" on later visits as new
responses are posted to them.  To read everything you haven't seen, do
"READ UNSEEN" instead of "READ NEW".

A listing of items in the current conference can be obtained with the
"BROWSE".

You can get out with the "QUIT" command.
