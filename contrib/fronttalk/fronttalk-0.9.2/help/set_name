                       Fronttalk Setting:  NAME

Usage:  DISPLAY NAME
        SET NAME

Display/set your default name in the current conference.  This is the full
name that will be attached to all the items and responses that you enter
in this conference (unless you enter a response with the PSEUDONYM command).

Note that you can have a different name in each conference.  Changing your
name with the "SET NAME" command changes it only in the current conference.
If you want to change your name in all conferences, then you have to do each
conference separately.
