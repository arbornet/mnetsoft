                        Fronttalk Defines:  PARTMSG

Usage:  DEFINE PARTMSG "<string>"

The PARTMSG define is used to generate the output from the PARTICIPANTS
command.  It called once with the 1x flag set to generate a header line,
once for each user with the 2x flag set to generate a line describing that
user, and once with the 4x flag set to generate a 'total' line.

For full details on its format, see help pages on SEPARATORS, CONFFUNC,
CONFCOND, and SEPDATE.

The default value is:

   "%(2x%10v %o %u%)\
    %(4x\n%k participant%S total.%)\
    %(1x\n   loginid        last time on      name\n%)"

Note that when PARTMSG is used to display a user, most of the item functions
operate differently:

   %u  - listed user's full name, instead of currently logged in user's.
   %v  - listed user's login id, instead of currently logged in user's.
   %o  - date listed user last read this conference, instead of date logged
         in user last logged into this conference.

The %s and %q functions still work the same to display the name of the current
conference, and %h and %H still display the server name but most of the other
functions don't in this one case.
