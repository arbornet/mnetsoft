                       Fronttalk Command:  LOGIN

Usage:  LOGIN

Some servers allow you to connect to them without requiring a login and
password.  If you connect in this anonymous manner then you cannot post.
You can read, but the server will not remember which material you have read,
so everything will always be new.

If you have connected to a server anonymously, and later decide you would
like to login, then you can issue the LOGIN command.  You will be prompted
for your login id and password, and if they are valid, you will be able
to participate fully in the conference.
