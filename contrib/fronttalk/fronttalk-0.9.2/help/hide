                       Fronttalk Command:  HIDE

Usage: HIDE <response number>               ("Respond or Pass?" prompt only)

Hide the response with the given number in the item currently being read.

Hidden responses are not displayed by default, but any user can still see
them by reading with the NOHIDE flag set (see "HELP SET NOHIDE"), or by
doing "ONLY <response number>" at the "Respond or Pass?" prompt.

Responses may be hidden because the author wants to retract the response
without making it unavailable to those who really want to see it, or because
the response is extremely long and not of universal interest.

Normally fairwitnesses and the author of the response have the power to hide
an item.

You can unhide an item with the SHOW command.

Synonyms:  EXPURGATE
