			       Item Ranges

Several commands require an item range to be given to select which items to
operate on.  They are used in the commands READ, BROWSE, FIND, FORGET,
REMEMBER, RETIRE, UNRETIRE, FREEZE, THAW and KILL.  The defaults are
different for different commands.

Individual items are usually referenced by number.  For example:
   73           Item number 73
   ^ or FIRST   The first item.
   $ or LAST    The last item.

Ranges can be formed by combining individual item references with a hyphen
or comma, plus there are short hands for all items:

   12-14        Items 12 through 14.
   12,14        Items 12 and 14.
   * or ALL     All items - shorthand for ^-$.

Various flags can be used to modify item ranges.  There are five different
forms that select only items with "new" responses.  When used with the
READ command, only the "new" responses will be shown.
   NEW           Only previously seen items with new responses or newly
                   entered items.
   NEWRESPONSE   Only previously seen items with new responses.
   BRANDNEW      Only newly entered items.
   UNSEEN        All items with unseen responses.  Most items that have had
                 no activity since before you joined the conference are
		 considered UNSEEN but not NEW.
   SINCE <date>  Only items with responses entered since the given date.
                 See "HELP DATE" for date syntax.

You can also select items by their author's login ID or by title keywords:

   (login,login) Only items entered by the users with the given logins
   "string"      Only items with the given string in the real or private title.

The following flags effect which items are included:
   NOFORGET      Don't omit forgotten items.
   FORGOTTEN     Include only forgotten items.
   FAVORITES     Include only favorite items.

The following flags effect the order in which the items are processed:
   REVERSE       Process the selected items in reverse order.
   FAVFIRST      Process favorite items first (this is the default).
   NOFAVFIRST    Don't process favorite items first.
   BNEWFIRST     Process brand new items first.
   BNEWLAST      Process brand new items last.
