                       Fronttalk Command:  FORGET

Usage:  FORGET <item range>

Mark all selected items forgotten.  Once an item is forgotten, it will not
be shown to you in the future when you run commands like "READ NEW",
"READ ALL" or "BROWSE".

If you wanted to see forgotten items when you READ or BROWSE, then you can
give the "NOFORGET" or "FORGOTTEN" options.

If you want to remove the "forgotten" flag from an item, use the REMEMBER
command.

For a full description of item ranges, do "HELP RANGE".  Here are some
common examples:

   FORGET 13         - Forget item 13.
   FORGET (joe)      - Forget items entered by login ID joe.

If you just say "FORGET" the default is to forget the current item.

In addition to the flags described in "HELP RANGE" you can also give the
CONFIRM flag on the command line.  Then each selected item's header will
be printed, and you will be asked if you want to forget it.
