                     Fronttalk Defines:  NSEP

Usage:  DEFINE NSEP "<string>"

The NSEP define is an item separator used during READ commands.  It
is displayed after the item header and text, but before the responses to
the item.  Normally it just reports the total number of responses.

For full details on its format, see help pages on SEPARATORS, ITEMFUNC,
ITEMCOND, and SEPDATE.

The default value is:

  "\n%(N%r new of %)%zn response%S total.\n"
