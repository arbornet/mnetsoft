                        Fronttalk Defines:  LOUTMSG

Usage:  DEFINE LOUTMSG "<string>"

The LOUTMSG define is a conference separator displayed when a user 
leaves a conference.  It is also displayed by "DISPLAY LOGOUT".

For full details on its format, see help pages on SEPARATORS, CONFFUNC,
CONFCOND, and SEPDATE.

The default value is:

   "%(1x%1g%)%c"

This just displays the conference logout file.
