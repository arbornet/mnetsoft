                       Fronttalk Setting:  SOURCE

Usage:  SET SOURCE
        SET NOSOURCE

If the SOURCE flag is set, then when you join a conference the conference rc
file, and your local and remote .cfrc files will be executed.  This is the
default.

If NOSOURCE is set, then none of these will be executed.

This does not effect the execution of the server RC file, and your local and
remote .cfonce files.
