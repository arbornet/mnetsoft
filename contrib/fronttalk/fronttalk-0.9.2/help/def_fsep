                  Fronttalk Defines:  FSEP and FTSEP

Usage:  DEFINE FSEP "<string>"
        DEFINE FTSEP "<string>"

The FSEP and FTSEP defines are item separators used to display results from
the FIND command.  FSEP is used for matches with the item text or response
text.  FTSEP is used for matches with the item title.

For full details on the format of item separators, see help pages on
SEPARATORS, ITEMFUNC, ITEMCOND, and SEPDATE.

The default value for FSEP is:

  "%(Ritem %i response %r (%l)%(L:\n%)%)%(L%7N: %L%)"

Note that the part in the "%(R" conditional is printed only if this result
is in a different item/response than any previously printed result.  The
part in the "%(L" conditional is matched only if the match was against a
particular line of the response.  If we did "FIND (joe)" then we get matches
against all responses entered by user 'joe', but not against any particular
line.

The default value for FTSEP is:

  "item %i (%l) title:\n         %h"
