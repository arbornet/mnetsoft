                       Fronttalk Command:  FREEZE

Usage:  FREEZE <item range>

Mark all selected items frozen.  Once an item is frozen, no user will be able
to post new response to it.  Fairwitnesses can freeze items in their
conferences.  Depending on the Backtalk server configuration, the original
author of an item may also be able to freeze it.

To unfreeze a frozen item, use the THAW command.

For a full description of item ranges, do "HELP RANGE".  Here are some
common examples:

   FREEZE 13         - Freeze item 13.
   FREEZE ALL        - Freeze all items in the conference.

If you just say "FREEZE" the default is to freeze the current item.

In addition to the flags described in "HELP RANGE" you can also give the
CONFIRM flag on the command line.  Then each selected item's header will
be printed, and you will be asked if you want to freeze it.
