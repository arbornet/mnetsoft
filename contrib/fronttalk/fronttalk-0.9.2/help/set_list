                       Fronttalk Setting:  LIST

Usage:  DISPLAY LIST
        SET LIST

Display/Edit your conference hot list on the current server.  This is a list
of favorite conferences you can create.  The CHECK command will give a summary
of the number of new responses in your hotlist conferences, and the NEXT
command will cycle you through them in the order listed.

The hotlist should just be a list of conference names, one per line.  You
cannot use a form like <server>:<confernence> here.  There are separate
hotlists for each server and each can only refer to conferences on that server.
(We hope to improve this in the future).
