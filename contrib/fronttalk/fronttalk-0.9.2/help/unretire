                       Fronttalk Command:  UNRETIRE

Usage:  UNRETIRE <item range>

Mark all selected items as not retired.  This undoes the effect of the
RETIRE command.

For a full description of item ranges, do "HELP RANGE".  If you just say
"UNRETIRE" without arguments then the current item will be unretired.

In addition to the flags described in "HELP RANGE" you can also give the
CONFIRM flag on the command line.  Then each selected item's header will
be printed, and you will be asked if you want to unretire it.
