                       Fronttalk Command:  PSEUDONYM

Usage: PSEUDONYM                            ("Respond or Pass?" prompt only)

This enters a new response into the item currently begin read, just like the
RESPOND command does, except that it will prompt you for the full name to use
when posting.  Note that your login ID will always be attached to the posting
so this cannot actually be used to hide your identity in any serious way.

See "HELP RESPOND" for more information.
