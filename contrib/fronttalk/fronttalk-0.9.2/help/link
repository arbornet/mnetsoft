                       Fronttalk Command:  LINK

Usage:  LINK <source conference> <item range>

Link all selected items from the given conference to current conference.
Linked items will appear in both conferences, under different item numbers.
Responses posted to either copy will appear in the other.  You must be a
fairwitness in the destination conference to be able to link in an item.

The CONFIRM flag can be given in the item range of a LINK command.  This
causes Fronttalk to ask for confimation before linking each item.

Fairwitnesses have somewhat reduced powers over linked items.  They can't,
for example, erase responses in linked items.  If they could, then a
fairwitness in one conference could erase responses in any conference
just by temporarily linking the item into his or her own conference.

You can move items between conferences by first linking them into the
destination conference, and then killing them in the source conference.
