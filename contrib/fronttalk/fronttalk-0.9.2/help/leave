                       Fronttalk Command:  LEAVE

Usage:  LEAVE                                          ("Ok:" prompt only)

Leave the the current conference, but don't exit Fronttalk.  This leaves
you in a funny conference-less mode with a "(no conf):" prompt.  You can
then use "join" to join another conference.
