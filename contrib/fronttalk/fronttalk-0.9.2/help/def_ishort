                     Fronttalk Defines:  ISHORT

Usage:  DEFINE ISHORT "<string>"

The ISHORT define is a conference separator used to generate the lines for
describing the status of each conference in "BROWSE SHORT".

For full details on its format, see help pages on SEPARATORS, CONFFUNC,
CONFCOND, and SEPDATE.

The default value is:

  "%(B\nitem nresp header\n\n%)%3i %3n %h"

Note that the string enclosed by the '%(B' conditional is printed only for
the first conference printed out by BROWSE, so it becomes a header line.
