                       Fronttalk Setting:  INDEX

Usage:  DISPLAY INDEX
        SET INDEX

Display/Edit the index file for the current conference.  Theoretically the
index file contains some brief information about the conference, like a
a list of currently active topics.  Users can display it by doing "DISPLAY
INDEX".  However, I've never seen a system where this is actually used for
anything.

The index can also be displayed/edited with the "DISPLAY AGENDA" and
"SET AGENDA" commands.

Only the fairwitness of the conference can "SET INDEX".
