                       Fronttalk Command:  READ

Usage:  READ <item range>                               ("Ok:" prompt only)

Display all items in the given range.  After each item, you'll be given a
"Respond or Pass?" prompt.  Type "R" to respond, hit <enter> to go on to
the next item, or type "HELP" for a complete list of "Respond or Pass?"
commands.

For a full description of item ranges, do "HELP RANGE".  Here are some
common examples:

   READ NEW       - Items entered or with new responses since you last read.
   READ ALL       - All items not forgotten.
   READ UNSEEN    - Items with responses you have not seen before.
   READ 13        - Only item 13.
   READ 14,22-31  - Item 14, and items 22 through 31.

If you just say "READ" the default is to do "READ NEW".

In addition to the flags described in "HELP RANGE" there are some additional
flags that work only on the READ command:

   NORESPONSE     - Don't display any responses - just goto "Respond or Pass"
   PASS           - Don't stop with "Respond or Pass" prompt between items.
   FORCERESPONSE  - Go directly to response entry for each item.
   DATE, NODATE   - Show or don't show timestamp for each response.
   UID, NOUID     - Show or don't show user id number for each response.
   NUMBERED       - Show line numbers on each line of each response.
   NOSKIP         - Do "Respond or Pass" even when item has no new responses.

The formating of the item can be controlled by redefining you separators
(see "HELP SEPARATORS").  The item will be filtered through a pager (see
"HELP PAGER").  The using pager is "more" which will pause the display after
each full screen.  Hit <space> to see the next screen.
