                            Fronttalk Define:  EDITOR

Usage:  DEFINE EDITOR "gate"

Whenever an item or response is to be entered, or when the conference hot
list is being edited, then Fronttalk invokes the Unix program specified by
the EDITOR variable to collect and edit the text.  The full path does not
need to be given.

The usual choice is the "gate" Text gatherer program.

In Picospan, use of an editor is optional - if none is defined, Picospan
has a built in text collection program.  Fronttalk lacks this, so the
editor is always invoked, just as it is in Picospan if EDALWAYS is defined.
