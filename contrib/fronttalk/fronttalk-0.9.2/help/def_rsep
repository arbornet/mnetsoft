                     Fronttalk Defines:  RSEP

Usage:  DEFINE RSEP "<string>"

The RSEP define is an item separator used to generate the header line
printed above each response during a READ.

For full details on its format, see help pages on SEPARATORS, ITEMFUNC,
ITEMCOND, and SEPDATE.

The default value is:

  "#%r %a:"

Probably a nicer value would be:

  "\n#%r of %n: by %a (%l) on %d:"

If an rsep is set that doesn't include checks to generate special
messages flagging hidden and erased responses, then Fronttalk will
automatically extend the isep to print messages like "<scribbled item>"
if appropriate.
