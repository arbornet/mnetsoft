                       Fronttalk Command:  HOLD

Usage: HOLD                                 ("Respond or Pass?" prompt only)
       HOLD <response number>

Go on to the next item, just like PASS, but do not mark the responses just
displayed as "seen".  If no response number is given, then the item will
be left as it was, so you will see the same responses again next time you do
"READ NEW".  If a response number is given, that that response and all
subsequent responses will be "new" the next time you read the conference, but
all previous responses will not be new.

This can be used if you don't have time to read or respond to the items
displayed, but want to come back to them later.

The NEW command also leaves responses marked unread, but exits to the "Ok:"
prompt instead of going on to read the next item.

Synonyms:  POSTPONE, PRESERVE
