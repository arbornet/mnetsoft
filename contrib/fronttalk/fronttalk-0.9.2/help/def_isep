                         Fronttalk Defines:  ISEP

Usage:  DEFINE ISEP "<string>"

The ISEP define is an item separator used to generate the header line
of items during "READ" and all the lines of "BROWSE LONG".

For full details on its format, see help pages on SEPARATORS, ITEMFUNC,
ITEMCOND, and SEPDATE.

The default value is:

  "\nItem %i entered %d by %a%(U uid %u%)\n %h"

Probably a nicer value would be:

  "\nItem %i: %h\nEntered by %a%(U uid %u%) (%l) on %d:"

If a separator is set that doesn't include checks to generate special
messages flagging retired, forgotten, frozen, or linked items, then
Fronttalk will automatically extend the isep to print messages like
"<linked item>" if appropriate.

The %(V and %(W conditions are true in iseps only in contexts where the
isep is being displayed immediately before the item text, and that item
text has been hidden or erased.  In contexts where the isep is displayed
without item text, such as in a BROWSE LONG or in a READ NEW when the item
text itself isn't new, they are false.  This is because these are attributes
of the item text only, not of the entire item.
