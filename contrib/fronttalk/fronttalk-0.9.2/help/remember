                       Fronttalk Command:  REMEMBER

Usage:  REMEMBER <item range>

Mark all selected items as not forgotten.

For a full description of item ranges, do "HELP RANGE".  If you just say
"REMEMBER" without arguments, the default is to remember the current item.

In addition to the flags described in "HELP RANGE" you can also give the
CONFIRM flag on the command line.  Then each selected item's header will
be printed, and you will be asked if you want to remember it.  So to review
all your forgotten items, you could do:

   REMEMBER FORGOTTEN CONFIRM
