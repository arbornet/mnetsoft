                       Fronttalk Command:  RETIRE

Usage:  RETIRE <item range>

Mark all selected items as retired.  Only a conference fairwitness or
(depending on the Backtalk server configuration) the original author of an
item may retire an item.  A retired item is effectively forgotten by all
users, so they will only see it if the use the "NOFORGET" or "FORGOTTEN"
flags on their READ and BROWSE commands.

A retired item can be restored to normal by doing "UNRETIRE".

For a full description of item ranges, do "HELP RANGE".  Here are some
common examples:

   RETIRE 13         - Retire item 13.
   RETIRE (joe)      - Retire items entered by login ID joe.

If you just say "RETIRE" the default is to retire the current item.

In addition to the flags described in "HELP RANGE" you can also give the
CONFIRM flag on the command line.  Then each selected item's header will
be printed, and you will be asked if you want to retire it.
