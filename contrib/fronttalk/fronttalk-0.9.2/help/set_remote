                       Fronttalk Setting:  REMOTE

Usage:  SET REMOTE
        SET SOMEREMOTE
        SET NOREMOTE

The RC files defined on remote servers may try change Fronttalk settings in
ways that are appropriate for users running Fronttalk or Picospan on that
server, but not for users accessing the server remotely.  In particular:

   * Defining commands which are aliases for Unix commands, like
       DEFINE MAIL 9 'UNIX "pine"'
     These Unix commands may not make sense on your local system.

   * Redefining PAGER or EDITOR.  These are also Unix commands which may
     not exist or may have different paths on your system.

If the SOMEREMOTE flag is set, then remote RC files will be executed, but
commands in these questionable categories will be skipped.  This is the
default.

If REMOTE is defined, all commands from remote RC files are executed.

If NOREMOTE is define, remote RC files are not executed at all.
