                        Fronttalk Defines:  CHECKMSG

Usage:  DEFINE CHECKMSG "<string>"

The CHECKMSG define is used to generate the output from the CHECK command.
It called once with the 1x flag set to generate a header line, and then
once for each conference with the 2x flag to generate a line describing that
conference.

Actually, the Fronttalk CHECK command currently ignores this completely.
Oops.

For full details on its format, see help pages on SEPARATORS, CONFFUNC,
CONFCOND, and SEPDATE.

The default value is:

   "%(1x\nnew resp items  conference\n%)\
   %(2x%(k--%E  %)%(B>%E %)%4r %4b %s%(B  (where you currently are!)%)%)"
