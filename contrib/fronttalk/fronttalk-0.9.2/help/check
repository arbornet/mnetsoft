                       Fronttalk Command:  CHECK

Usage:  CHECK                                           ("Ok:" prompt only)
        CHECK <conference> ...

Check for activity in some conferences.  In the first form, the list of
conferences to be checked is taken from your hotlist on the current server.
In the second form, the conferences to check are listed on the command line.

For each conference, the number of "newresponse" and "brandnew" items will
be given.  If your current conference is on the list, it will be marked with
an arrow.

Currently there is a different hotlist on each server, stored in a file
named .cflist.  You'd be able to use the "CHANGE LIST" command to edit it
if Fronttalk supported that command yet.

Currently you cannot use conference names of the form <server>:<conference>
on this command.
