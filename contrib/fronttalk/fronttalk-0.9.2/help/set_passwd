                       Fronttalk Setting:  PASSWORD

Usage:  SET PASSWORD
        SET PASSWD
	PASSWD

Any of these command will change the user's password on the server to which
they are currently connected to.  If that is a local server to which we are
directly connected, this just runs the unix 'passwd' program.  If it is a
remote server this only works if it is configured to use Backtalk accounts,
not user accounts.
