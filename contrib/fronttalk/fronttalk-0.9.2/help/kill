                       Fronttalk Command:  KILL

Usage:  KILL <item range>

Delete an item permanently and irrevocably from the conference.  Each selected
items header will be printed, and you will be asked if you really want to
kill it.

For a full description of item ranges, do "HELP RANGE".  If you just say
"KILL" without arguments, the default is to kill the current item.

If an item is linked to multiple conferences, this only removes it from the
current conference, not all other conferences.

In addition to the flags described in "HELP RANGE" you can also give the
NOCONFIRM flag on the command line.  Then all selected items will be killed
without stopping to ask if you you really want to kill each one.
