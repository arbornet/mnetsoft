Grex / Party / Installation

Party is a rewrite of Marcus Watt's program by Jan Wolter and is distributed
from his jan's web site at http://www.unixpapa.com/party.html

*******************************
Create Suidbin Directory first.
*******************************

This installs configuration scripts from the grexdoc directory.  You should
make sure these are the most recent copies, especially for chantab and noisetab
which change frequently.

Make sure the 'party' user and 'partyadm' group have been created.  The program
will run suid-party.  Configuration files will be write permitted to group
partyadm so that people in that group can edit them.

Check the web page to see what the latest version is.

If the latest version is 2.12, then you would do:

   cd grexdoc/party
   ./build party-2.12
   ./install party-2.12

The 'build' command will fetch the distribution from Jan's web site,
configure it, and compile it.

The 'install' command copies the binaries to the right places, permits
them correctly, makes some symbolic links

Theoretically these scripts can be used for upgrades too.

You'll need to install a line in the crontab to roll the party logs.
This is

	22 5 * * 0      /usr/local/libexec/roll_party_log

Actually, this should probably as 'party', not as 'root', so you should
enter this line using:

   crontab -u party -e
