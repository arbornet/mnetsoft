% Backtalk Configuration Script -- (c) 1996, Jan Wolter, Steve Weiss
%
% config.bt script
%
% This script is included automatically as a header to any other script.  It
% is the only place from which protected system variables can be redefined,
% and is intended as the primary run-time configuration file for backtalk.


% Initialize User Dictionary -- Put a dictionary on the user dictionary
% stack so that we can define variables (so obviously this needs to be done
% first).

dict begin

% INFINITE LOOP TIMEOUT -- Backtalk will bomb after the given number of
% seconds.  This is intended to save things if a script goes into an infinite
% loop.  If all your scripts are thoroughly debugged, you can set this to
% 0, meaning never timeout.

420 timeout

% AUTOMATIC RECOMPILATION -- If the auto_recompile variable is set to 2,
% Backtalk will always check if any of the associated source files have been
% modified since a binary was last compiled.  If so, it will recompile it
% before executing it.  If auto_recompile is set to 1, it only checks the
% binary date against the date of config.bt (this file).  If it is set to
% 0, none of these checks are made.
%
% NOTE: If you change this from 0 to anything else, you will have to
% manually recompile some script (which will cause this config.bt to be
% recompiled) before the change will have any effect.

/auto_recompile 2 def

% BACKTALK URLS -- There are typically three different URLs for the backtalk
% cgi-bin program - two that require authentication to run, one that can
% be run anonymously.  Adm_url, pw_url and anon_url are the URLs of those
% scripts.  (Adm_url is used mostly for administrative tasks.)  Note that in
% many places we just use the SCRIPT_NAME environment variable instead of
% these, but they are still useful when we want to cross reference between
% the anonymous and authenticated pages.

% SITE IDENTIFICATION:  LOGO IMAGES -- These are URLs of logo images that the
% interfaces may display at the top of some or all of the pages.  A standard
% logo should be defined for all installations.  Currently very few interfaces
% use the wide logo, and all can use the standard logo if no wide logo is

% ENABLE OPEN LOGIN ACCOUNT CREATION  -- If this is 0, new login accounts can
% only be created by administrators (namely members of the 'cfadm' and
% 'gradm' groups.  If it is 1, then random people coming in off the net
% can run the public/newuser script to create themselves an account, but that
% account won't be usable until and administrator has validated it.  If this
% is set to 2, then random people can create accounts, and the accounts will
% be instantly usable, without the administrators needing to take any
% action.  It defaults to 2.

/newuseropen 2 defconstant

% ALLOW UNAUTHENTICATED READERS -- If this is 1, unauthenticated users can
% have read access to conferences, but cannot post.  If it is 0,
% unauthenticated users can only run the welcome script and the other scripts
% in the public directories listed below.  It defaults to 1.

/allowanon 1 defconstant

% PUBLIC FLAVORS -- This is a comma-separated list of of the script directories
% that may be accessed by users who are not logged in, even if anonymous
% logins are turned off.  It may be desirable to include 'cinnamon' here, if
% you want people to be able to get headline feeds from a site that does not
% allow anonymous reading.

/publicflavors (public) defconstant

% AUTHOR POWERS -- Can authors freeze, kill, retire, or retitle items they
% entered?  (Even if enabled, authors can only kill items if there are no
% responses to them yet.)  Can they erase, hide or edit responses they entered?
% Normally these are all enabled by default, except author_edit, which is
% spooky.

% FAIRWITNESS POWERS -- Can conference fairwitneseses retitle items, or
% hide, erase or edit responses to items in their conferences?  Normally
% these are all enabled by default, except fw_edit, which is a bit spooky.

/fw_edit    0 defconstant

% FROZEN ITEMS -- Picospan and older Backtalk versions didn't allow
% responses in frozen items to be erased, hidden, shown, or editted, nor
% did they allow frozen items to be retitled.  To enable all these operations
% on frozen items, set the "editfrozen" flag to 1.  Making these work require
% that items be briefly partially thawed while opening the item file for the
% operation, which creates a microscopic risk that a frozen item might briefly
% appear to be thawed, which probably won't happen and probably doesn't matter.

/editfrozen 1 defconstant

% ANONYMITY LEVEL -- Which users can see other user's fullnames on postings
% (aliases) and bio information (including their "real" names and other
% personal info.  Settings are:
%
%   anonymity     aliases can be seen by:      bios can be seen by:

/anonymity 0 defconstant

% ALLOW HTML -- Fairwitnesses can set a switch saying whether or not HTML
% postings are allowed in their conferences.  The following switch determines
% whether or not HTML postings are allowed in conferences where the fair
% witness has not yet set the switch one way or the other.  Define it to
% 1 if HTML should be allowed by default, or 0 if it should be disallowed
% by default.

/dflt_html 1 defconstant

% OPEN EXTERNAL LINKS IN NEW WINDOWS -- By default, if a user clicks on a
% link in a posting by another user, then that link is opened in a new
% window.  If linktonew is defined to zero, clicking on external links
% will open the URL in the backtalk window instead.

%/linktonew 0 defconstant

% SHOW_MOTD -- If defined, we show all users the system /etc/motd file
% instead of the bbs/motd.html file.

%/show_motd 1 defconstant

% USE .PLAN -- Backtalk can store secondary user information (things like
% sex, date of birth, etc.) in it's own database, or in the standard unix
% .plan files.  If the "useplan" is true, then .plan files will be used.

%/useplan 1 defconstant

% TEXT_INTERFACE -- If the conferences may also be read through a text
% interface, this constant should be defined to the name of that interface
% (usually "Picospan" or "Yapp").  When people preview their HTML postings,
% they will see a plain text version as well as the HTML version.  Normally
% this is only defined if you compiled Backtalk with the PICOSPAN_COMPAT or
% YAPP_COMPAT flag.

%/text_interface (Picospan) defconstant

% USE PUBLIC.TXT -- Picospan keeps the list of conferences in a free-format
% text file called public.txt.  Backtalk prefers to use a more rigidly
% formated file call confmenu, but can use public.txt.  So if you are using
% Backtalk with Picospan, and don't want to maintain both files, then define
% this.
%
% If /usepublic_txt is defined, then the two regular expressions /pt_confline
% and /pt_headline must be defined too.  The /pt_confline expression should
% match any line of the public.txt file that describes a conference.  It should
% contain two sets of parenthesis - the first enclosing the part that matches
% the conference name, the second enclosing the part that matches the
% conference description.  The /pt_headline matches all section headers in the
% conference list.  It contains one set of parenthesis, which matches the title
% of that section.  Lines in public.txt which match neither of these patterns
% will be ignored.

%/usepublic_txt 1 defconstant

% MANY USERS -- If you expect to have many thousands of users on your system,
% and your computer isn't all that fast, then set this flag to 1.  It changes
% some of the system's behavior in ways to accomodate such large numbers of
% users.  Mainly the option of sorting the list of users while searching for
% users disappears, because the memory and computation used get to be a real
% problem.

/many_users 0 defconstant

% SHYFILE -- The shy file is a the full path name of a file that contains a
% list of users who don't want to have their responses readable by unregistered
% users.  If you don't want or need a shylist, don't define this string.

%/shyfile (@res_etcdir@/shylist) defconstant

% REGISTRATION URL -- This is a URL of a page that tells users how to register
% for an account on your system.  The value below is for the Backtalk newuser
% program.  If you are using a foreign newuser program, change this.

/register_url anon_url(public/newuser)+ defconstant

% EXTERNAL USER BIO PAGES - Backtalk maintains a 'bio' page that a user can
% edit to display information about himself.  If you are using user accounts
% created by some other program, then you may well want to use that' programs
% user information display/editing tools.  In that case, define extern_bio
% here, and edit the script/lib/biolink.bt script to teach it to generate the
% correct URLs.  Otherwise, leve this undefined.
%
% This is not currently supported by the Pistachio interface.

% /extern_bio 1 defconstant

% ROBOT EXCLUSION
% Backtalk can generate meta tags to exclude well-mannered indexing robots
% from some or all of the pages it generates.  For conference pages, we set
% the /confrobots variable to one of the following values:
%
%   0   Generate no meta tag - unless you do something else, like put in a
%       robots.txt file, all conference pages may be indexed.
%
%   1   Allow fairwitnesses to determine whether their confernces may be
%       indexed.  Conference index pages may always be indexed.
%
%   2   No indexing allowed.  All conference pages have exclude tags.
%
% Indexing of user bio pages is controlled by the /biorobots variable, which,
% if 0 allows indexing, and if 1 denies it.

/confrobots 0 defconstant
/biorobots 0 defconstant

% SPELL CHECK LANGUAGES - These are the languages supported by your 'aspell'
% or 'ispell' installation, used only if you configured Backtalk with the
% --with-aspell or --with-ispell options.  It's just a comma-separated list of
% dictionary names that are legal on the 'ispell -d language' command.  For
% aspell versions after 0.50, you can get a list by doing 'aspell dump dicts'.

/languages (en,en_US,en_CA,en_GB) defconstant   % typical minimum aspell
%/languages (american,british) defconstant      % typical minimum ispell

% SYNDICATION - The following settings should only be enabled if you are
% installing the 'cinnamon' syndication interface, which provide RSS.  This
% is a technology that lets other programs display "headlines" from your
% Backtalk site.  The settings here control how all other interfaces advertise
% the RSS feed.  First the following two links define which methods are used
% to advertise the feed.
%
%    use_rss_icon              if non-zero, display orange 'XML' buttons.
%    use_rss_aoutodiscovery    if non-zero, include autodiscovery links.
%
% If neither of these two is true, the other interfaces will not advertise the
% RSS URIs, and the definitions below will be ignored.
%
% The next two definitions define which RSS feeds to advertise.  If they are
% non-zero, the corresponding RSS feed type is advertised by all the methods
% selected above.
%
%   expose_rss_conf     list of items in a given conference
%   expose_rss_item     list of responses in a given item.
%
% If use_rss_icon is defined, rss_icon gives the URL of the icon image.  One
% is installed by the cinnamon distribution.

/use_rss_icon 0 defconstant
/use_rss_autodiscovery 0 defconstant
/expose_rss_conf 1 defconstant
/expose_rss_item 1 defconstant
/rss_icon imghost(/xml.png)+ defconstant

% FAVICON - Some browsers (IE 5 and Konqueror) like to request an icon image
% called 'favicon.ico' from web sites.  IE uses it for bookmarks.  Normally
% backtalk responds to all such requests with an empty document.  If you
% have a custom .ico file for your site that you would like sent, set the
% favicon variable to to the full path of that file.  Leaving this undefined
% is the more common option.  Visit www.favicon.com for more info.

% /favicon (/home/httpd/html/favicon.ico) def

% POST LOGS --  The post log file is an optional log file which has a line
% appended to it every time a new response is posted or a new item is entered.
% These logs can be used to generate listings of the "last N responses" and
% such.  We can support these in a couple different formats (well, actually
% just about any format, if you edit lib/postlog.bt and lib/readpostlog.bt).
%
% For a Backtalk-format postlog file, uncomment the following two lines
% and edit the first to be the location of the log.

%/post_log_file (@res_logdir@/post.log) defconstant
%/bt_post_log 1 defconstant

% For a Yapp-compatible resplog file, uncomment the following three lines, edit
% the first to the full pathname of the file and edit the second to the base
% URL of Yapp's CGI's on your machine.

%/post_log_file (/usr/bbs/resplog) defconstant
%/yapp_resplog_url (http://www.spring.net/yapp-bin) defconstant
%/yapp_post_log 1 defconstant

% WEB YAPP COMPATIBLE HTML RESPONSE FORMATTING -- If you are actually sharing
% conference files between Backtalk and Web Yapp (not command-line Yapp)
% turning this on will help.  If this is 1 or 3, then all Backtalk postings,
% even those posted as "plain text" will be stored as HTML, so that they
% look the same in Yapp as in Backtalk.  If this is 2 or 3, then any
% responses not flagged as HTML responses are presumed to have been posted
% by Yapp, and thus contain dirty HTML, not plain text.  They will be
% cleaned up and then treated as HTML responses, only with a <BR> appended
% to each line.  So Yapp responses with good HTML will look the same in
% Backtalk and Yapp, and Yapp responses with bad HTML will be fixed in
% Backtalk.  If you are not running Backtalk with Web Yapp, don't set this,
% or set it to 0.

% /yapp_formats 3 def

% SESSION STUFF -- If Backtalk is built with --login=cookies, the it uses
% session ids to track users, and the following settings effect the system's
% behavior.  If you are using basic authentication, they are ignored.
%  
% expire_session -- If a user submits no requests for more than this many
%   seconds, log him off.  It's usually good to set this fairly long, because
%   people typing long responses can go a long time without clicking any
%   buttons.
%
% logout_url -- URL to jump to after a user clicks the logout button.  Usually
%   some sort of front page for your system.

/expire_session 3600 defconstant		% one hour
/logout_url anon_url defconstant		% Backtalk welcome page

% DEBUG SWITCHES -- The following settings are used for debugging.  They
% should not be left turned on in production systems because they can introduce
% substantial security holes.
%
%   If saverep is turned on, Backtalk saves the last HTTP query sent to it
%   to a file.  Enough information is saved so that the query can be
%   exactly re-executed using the 'backtalk -r' command.  This is typically
%   used to rerun a failed query under gdb.
%
%   If secure is turned off, Backtalk doesn't check that the program is being
%   run by the httpd user before trusting the environment variables that
%   identify the user.  On some installations this will be needed to be able
%   to run 'backtalk -r'.

% /saverep 1 defconstant    % INSECURE TO SET THIS TO NON-ZERO
% /secure 0 defconstant	    % INSECURE TO SET THIS TO ZERO
