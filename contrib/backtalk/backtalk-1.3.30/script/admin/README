The admin scripts are meant to be useful only to the conference administrator.
They invoke functions that will only work for the conference administrator.

   admin/makeconf.bt   -   Script to create a conference.  This just creates
                           a basic conference with mostly default setting.
                           The editconf.bt script is used to customize it.

   admin/editmenu.bt   -   Script to edit the conference menu.  This edits
   			   the menu that is shown to users when they ask for
   			   a list of conferences.
