<H1>Backtalk Installation Guide</H1>
Version 1.3.30
<P>

<P>
Backtalk is an advanced web-based computer conferencing system written
and distributed by Jan Wolter and Steve Weiss.  For general information
about Backtalk, see the
<A HREF="http://www.unixpapa.com/backtalk">Backtalk</A> home page.
This document describes the procedure for installing Backtalk on a Unix
system.
The <A HREF=glossary.html>Backtalk Glossary</A> will help you with some
of the terminology used here.
<P>
We have expended substantial effort to make the installation process for
Backtalk as simple as possible, but it is still more complex than most other
packages.  There is more to it than just doing
"<TT>./configure; make install</TT>".
(Though that might be all it takes in a few cases.)
<P>
The complexity of installing Backtalk is partly due to Backtalk's high degree
of configurability, and partly due to the necessity of interacting with
your http server, which may be configured many different ways.
The installation process is not, however, as complex as the bulk of this
installation manual would suggest (because we do rather run on, don't we?).
However we do recommend reading through this manual as you do the installation.
If you have questions or problems, please
contact us at <A HREF="mailto:backtalk@hvcn.org">backtalk@hvcn.org</A>,
so that we can help you and refine this installation guide.
<P>
Backtalk must run on a host running some brand of Unix.  Sorry, no Windows
or Macintosh OS9 versions are available (or likely to be any time soon).
Our objective is to make it work on any flavor of Unix.
It has actually been tested on a fair variety of Unixes,
including (in decreasing order of thoroughness):
<UL>
<LI>Linux
<LI>SunOS 4.1
<LI>OpenBSD
<LI>FreeBSD
<LI>NetBSD
<LI>Solaris
<LI>Mach (NeXTStep)
<LI>Ultrix
</UL>
It probably works on almost any other Unix as well, probably including
Macintosh OSX.
<P>
One of the key decisions that you will have to make,
and which will impact much of the installation process,
is what kind of authentication you wish to use.
When Backtalk users connect to your conferencing system, they will give a
login name and a password to identify themselves.  Backtalk can be configured
one of three main ways:
<UL>
<LI>
<EM>Authenticate with Backtalk accounts.</EM>
The login/password gives access to Backtalk,
but does not let users log onto your system via telnet, rlogin, or ftp.
The Backtalk accounts are not real Unix accounts, instead the
authentication database is maintained directly by Backtalk.
This is the simplest and most common way to set up Backtalk.
(Note that Backtalk will maintain a directory for each user's files that it
calls a "home directory" and it will assign a unique ID number to each user
that it calls a "uid number" - but these values are <EM>not</EM> real Unix
"home directories" or "uid numbers".)
<P>
<LI>
<EM>Authenticate with real Unix accounts.</EM>
The host system's /etc/passwd database will be used to authenticate
Backtalk users.
This way any user that can telnet to the system can use the same login
and password to run Backtalk.
Backtalk's files will be kept in the user's actual Unix home directory,
and will be owned by the user instead of Backtalk,
so they can be shared with Picospan or command-line Yapp.
That is the primary reason you might prefer this configuration
- if you want to allow your users
a choice between conferencing with a telnet-based interface like Picospan
or Yapp, or with a web-based interface like Backtalk.
None of the account administration tools included in Backtalk will work
in this configuration
(you should use the standard Unix account administration tools to create,
destroy and edit accounts).
<P>
Installation will be a bit more complex than the other option, and you
will need to obtain the separately distributed
<A HREF=http://www.unixpapa.com/mod_auth_external.html>mod_auth_external</A>
package, and the "pwauth" program included in that package.  This is a free
extension to the Apache http server which enables secure authentication from
Unix shadow password files.
<P>
<LI>
<EM>Some Other Existing Authentication System.</EM>
If you already have some kind of authentication system running on your
web site that lets users log in with password and login ID, then you might
want those logins to work for Backtalk too instead of making your users
login separately to use Backtalk.
<P>
Backtalk supports a fairly large number
of moderately standard authentication databases, so there is at least a
chance that one of the existing configurations will work for you without
modification.  If your user database is in an SQL database, then it may be
fairly easy to make Backtalk work with that database, as Backtalk's SQL
interface is pretty easily customizable.  Otherwise, you may have to do
some C coding to implement a new authentication module for Backtalk.
This is a bit more challenging, but it's still probably going to be a lot
easier to modify Backtalk to play nicely with your other applications than
to modify them to play nicely with Backtalk.
<P>
These installation instructions won't tell you too much about how to customize
the authentication system beyond the normal array of options built into
Backtalk.  There is a separate document with <A HREF=auth.html>advice on how
to customize Backtalk's authentication system</A> to work with pre-existing
user databases.  Aside from that, the installation is probably going to be
similar to the standard "backtalk accounts" installation procedure described
here.
</UL>
<P>
To set up Backtalk with real Unix accounts, you will need root access
on your system.
An installation with Backtalk accounts, however, can be done by anyone
with enough access to install cgi-bin programs, though it is simpler if you
have root access.
<P>
Backtalk can be convinced to cooperate nicely with web versions of Yapp, but
it's a somewhat finicky process.  Getting along with command-line Yapp or
Picospan is simpler.
<P>
Once you've decided which of these major variations you want, you are ready
to start the installation process.  Separate pages describe each part of
the installation process:
