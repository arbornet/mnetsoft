The install scripts will not save your old customizations.  You should make a
backup of your old installation.  The following files are especially likely
to have been customized on your site, and may be especially important to save:
<BR>&nbsp;<BR><TT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;script/config.bt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;script/pistachio/config.bt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;script/abalone/config.bt<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc/backtalk.conf
</TT><BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<LI><STRONG><FONT COLOR=red>Don't run 'make install-users'.</FONT></STRONG><BR>
This may mess up all your existing accounts.

This may mess up all your existing conferences.

In a normal Backtalk installation, most files and directories
are owned by the owner account (usually called 'backtalk') but a few must be
owned by the account httpd runs under (usually 'nobody').  The easy way
to create files owned by two different users is to do the installation as
root.  But it can still be done if are not root so long as you have access
to both the owner and httpd accounts.

</TABLE>
Note that if you are installing a system that will run under <TT>suExec</TT>
or <TT>cgiwrap</TT> then <TT>owner-id</TT> and <TT>httpd-id</TT> are the same.
If you are logged into that account, you should be able to use the root
installation commands.
<P>
If you are creating a new user database, then the Backtalk conference
administration account will also be created.  The last of the make commands
will ask you to enter a password to use for this account.
<P>
If you aren't root and you can't actually log in as <TT>httpd-id</TT> to
execute the commands,
then write a little CGI program named something like <TT>install.cgi</TT>
containing commands something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
	#!/bin/sh
	echo "Content-type: text/plain"
	echo
	cd /distribution/directory/for/backtalk
	make install-binaries-httpd
	make install-users-httpd
</PRE>
Install the script in the appropriate cgi-bin directory and
permit it to be executable ("<TT>chmod 755 install.cgi</TT>").
Then use your browser to execute that script.  The web server should run
the script as the appropriate user, and display the output on your browser
screen.
<STRONG>Remove the script from the cgi-bin directory when you are done.</STRONG>
