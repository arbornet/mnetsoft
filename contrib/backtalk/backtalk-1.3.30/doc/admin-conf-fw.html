Fairwitnesses are the hosts of conferences, how have special powers enabling
them to administrate particular conferences.
You can changing the fairwitnesses of an existing conference either from
Backtalk's web interface or from Unix.

<H2>Changing Fair-Witnesses From Backtalk:</H2>

To change the fairwitnesses of a Backtalk conference, follow the following
steps.
(The checkboxes below perform no function -
they are just for your convenience.)
<FORM>
<OL>
<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Log into the administration account
<P>
See the <A HREF=admin-menu.html>logging in instructions</A>.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Goto the conference edit page.
<P>
There is a link on the administration page labelled "Edit a Conference".
Click on this.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Specify the conference to be edited.
<P>
You will be shown a form one box.  Enter the name of the conference that
you want to edit here and kill the button labeled "Edit It".

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Specify the new fairwitnesses.
<P>
The form that comes up next will include a textbox containing the current
list of fairwitnesses.  Edit this.
You can list more than one fairwitness, so long as the names are separated
by commas (but not spaces).
<P>
When you are done, click on the "Change Settings" button.
<HR>
</OL>

<H2>Changing Fair-Witnesses From Unix:</H2>

The procedure used to change fair-witnesses from Unix 
is identical to that used for Picospan or Yapp 2.3 conferences.
<P>
To change the fairwitnesses of a Backtalk conference, follow the following
steps.
(The checkboxes below perform no function -
they are just for your convenience.)
<FORM>
<OL>
<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Log onto the Unix conference administration account.
<P>
This is the account that owns all the conference files and the backtalk
program itself.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> change directory to conference directory
<P>
Each conference has a directory where all its files are kept.  There is a
pointer to this directory in the <TT>conflist</TT> file.  The location
of the <TT>conflist</TT> file depends on how your system is configured.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Edit the conference <TT>config</TT> file
<P>
Inside the conference directory, you will find (among other things) a
file named <TT>config</TT>.  This is the file we need to edit to change
the conference fairwitnesses.
A typical <TT>config</TT> file looks like this:
<PRE>
    !&lt;pc02&gt;
    .martian1.cf
    0
    marvin,carter
</PRE>
(There may be some additional lines at the end.)
The fourth line of this tells us the names of the current fairwitnesses of
the conference.
All we need to do to change the fairwitnesses is edit this line.
It should just be a list of the Backtalk login names of the users who are
to be fairwitnesses.  If there is more than one, their names should be
separated by commas (but no spaces).
There should always be at least one fairwitness.
