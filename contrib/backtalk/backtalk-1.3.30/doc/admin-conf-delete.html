<H2>Conference Deletion</H2>

<P>
Backtalk conference deletion can be done either through the web interface,
or from Unix.
For systems using real unix user accounts, there is one stage of the conference
deletion that currently must be done from Unix.
Both procedures are described here.
<P>
Note that if you follow the procedures here you will destroy
all items and responses in the conference,
as well as all the conference configuration information and all
records of which responses each user has seen.
If you ever want any of this information back again,
you should <A HREF=admin-conf-backup.html>back up</A>
the conference before deleting it.

<H2>Conference Deletion From Backtalk:</H2>

To delete a Backtalk conference, follow the following steps.
(The checkboxes below perform no function -
they are just for your convenience.)
<FORM>
<OL>
<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Log into the administration account
<P>
See the <A HREF=admin-menu.html>logging in instructions</A>.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Remove the conference from the conference menu
<P>
First we should delete the conference from the list of conferences
presented to users (unless you plan to start a new conference in the
place of the old one, in which case you can skip to the next step.)
<P>
There is a link labelled "Edit the Conference Menu" on the administration
page.  Click on it.
<P>
The next page will show the conference menu.  Click on the red "Delete"
button next to the conference you are deleting.
<P>
Note that this step only deletes the conference from the menu.
The conference itself is still there on your disk, and though people can't
join it by selecting it off the menu, they can still join it
it by typing the name in the "goto conference" box.
<P>
To actually delete the conference from your disk,
you need to follow the rest of the steps in this procedure.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Goto the conference deletion page
<P>
Return to the conference adminstration page.
There is a link there labelled "Delete a Conference".
Click on this.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Specify the conference to be deleted.
<P>
You will be shown a form one box.  Enter the name of the conference that
you want to delete here and kill the button labeled "Kill It".

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Confirm that you really want to delete it.
<P>
Since deleting conferences can destroy a lot of information in an 
irreversable fashion, Backtalk is rather reluctant to do so on the strength
of one button click.
<P>
So the next screen you will see will ask you if you really want to kill the
conference.
There are three selectable buttons displaying the letters A-A-A on this page.  
Change them one at a time until they spell out the word Y-E-S.
Then click on the kill button.
<P>
The conference will have been deleted.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> For Unix accounts, clean up participation files.
<P>

If your backtalk installation is set up so that all users have Unix accounts
on your server and log in with those accounts (this is rare), then there is
one more step to perform.
You have to delete the participation files for the conference from each
user's home directory.
There is currently no way to do this from the Backtalk web interface.
You need to do it from Unix, as described <A HREF=#mark>below</A>.

<HR>
</OL>

<H2>Conference Deletion From Unix:</H2>

<P>
The conference deletion procedure is identical to that used for Picospan
or Yapp 2.3 conferences.
<P>
To delete a Backtalk conference, follow the following steps.
(The checkboxes below perform no function -
they are just for your convenience.)
<FORM>
<OL>
<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Log onto the Unix conference administration account.
<P>
This is the account that owns all the conference files and the backtalk
program itself.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> change directory to the ``bbs'' directory.
<P>
This is the directory where the <TT>conflist</TT> file and all the conference
directories normally reside.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Edit the <TT>conflist</TT> file.
<P>

The <TT>conflist</TT> file resides in the top level "bbs" directory.
It is used to map typed names of conferences to the actual directory names
where the conference is stored.
You can use any standard Unix text editor to edit it, such as:
<PRE>
        vi conflist
</PRE>
A typical conflist file might look like this:
<PRE>
    !&lt;hl01&gt;
    /usr/local/backtalk/bbs/general2
    gen_eral2:/usr/local/backtalk/bbs/general2
    general1:/usr/local/backtalk/bbs/general1
    oldgen_eral:/usr/local/backtalk/bbs/general1
    tes_t1:/usr/local/backtalk/bbs/test1
    mar_tian1:/usr/local/backtalk/bbs/martian1
    mars:/usr/local/backtalk/bbs/martian1
    bar_soom:/usr/local/backtalk/bbs/martian1
</PRE>
Or, if you are using the shortened format,
The path names of the top level bbs directory (``<TT>/usr/local/backtalk/bbs/</TT>''
in the example will be replaced with percent signs, so that it looks more
like this:
<PRE>
    !&lt;hl01&gt;
    %general2
    gen_eral2:%general2
    general1:%general1
    oldgen_eral:%general1
    tes_t1:%test1
    mar_tian1:%martian1
    mars:%martian1
    bar_soom:%martian1
</PRE>
Suppose we want to delete version one of the ``Martian'' conference, which is
stored in the <TT>martian1</TT> directory.
<P>
We should start by deleting all the lines in the <TT>conflist</TT> which
point to that directory, in this case, the last three lines of the file.
<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Edit the <TT>public.txt</TT> file.
<P>
The <TT>public.txt</TT> file is a human-readable list of conferences, used
by the interfaces to generate lists of conferences.
You should edit this file, removing any line describing the conference
you are deleting.
<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox>
<A NAME="mark"> Remove the user participation files</A>
<P>
Backtalk maintains a participation file for each user who is a member of
a conference.
Since we are deleting the conference, we should delete this participation
files too.
<P>
The name of the participation file is in the conference's <TT>config</TT>
file.  In this case, our conference was in the
<TT>/usr/local/backtalk/bbs/martian1</TT>
directory, so the configuration file is
<TT>/usr/local/backtalk/bbs/martian1/config</TT>.
If we look at this file, we will see something like this:
<PRE>
    !&lt;pc02&gt;
    .martian1.cf
    0
    marvin,carter
</PRE>
The second line of this tells us the name of the participation file for
the conference, in this case <TT>.martian1.cf</TT>.
So we need to delete this file from each user's directory.
<P>
The easiest way to do this is with a Unix <TT>find</TT> command.
First you need to know where your user's home directories are.
If your Backtalk is set up to use real user accounts this may be
place like <TT>/home</TT>, but more likely
you are using separate Backtalk accounts for your Backtalk users, so you
user directory may be something like <TT>/usr/local/backtalk/user</TT>.
Supposing the latter, you could remove all the <TT>.martian1.cf</TT> files
using a command like:
<PRE>
    find /usr/local/backtalk/user -name .martian1.cf -exec rm "{}" \;
</PRE>
This searchs under for all files named <TT>.martian1.cf</TT> under the
<TT>/usr/local/backtalk/user</TT> directory and deletes each one.
Obviously some caution is required with commands like this.
<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Remove the conference directory.
<P>
Everything else related to the Martian conference is in the directory that
the <TT>conflist</TT> file was pointing to (in this example, the directory
<TT>/usr/local/backtalk/bbs/martian1</TT>).
To finish the job of deleting the conference,
we need only delete this directory.
So, first make any backups of it that you might want, and then do
<PRE>
    rm -r /usr/local/backtalk/bbs/martian1
</PRE>
to delete the directory and all of its contents.
