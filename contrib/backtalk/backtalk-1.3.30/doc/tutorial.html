<H2>1. Introduction</H2>

Backtalk's script language is, well, unusual.
It's a stack-based language, which means everything is written backwards.
If you know the Postscript language then Backtalk's language will be very
familiar.
If you know the Forth language, then you have the basic idea.
However, most likely you don't and probably Backtalk scripts will look totally
weird to you.
If you've used an old Hewlett-Packard RPN calculator or have a reasonably
good grounding in computer science then at least you have the
advantage of knowing about postfix notation.
<P>
This document is meant to give a enough of a basic introduction to the
Backtalk script language to help you figure out what you are seeing when
you look at a script, and make simple changes.
<P>
For full details of the language, see the
<A HREF=language.html>Backtalk Script Language Reference Manual</A>.

<H2>2. Postfix Notation and Stacks</H2>

This section introduces the basic idea of the Reverse Polish or
Infix Notation used by Backtalk.
<P>
In a typical procedural computer language, you might write a statement
like this:
<PRE>
   print("The answer is ",(abs(x) + 1) * 5);</PRE>
This is a mixture of <EM>prefix</EM> notation and <EM>infix</EM> notation.
The <TT>print</TT> and <TT>abs</TT> function are in prefix notation.  The
operator name <EM>preceeds</EM> a list of arguments.  The <TT>+</TT> and
<TT>*</TT> functions are in infix notation, with function name
<EM>in between</EM> its arguments.
<P>
<EM>Postfix</EM> notation writes the operator after the arguments.  So the
statement above would be written as:
<PRE>
   "The answer is " x abs 1 + 5 * print</PRE>
That's pretty weird looking.  Let's take a simpler example:
<PRE>
   2 1 + 5 * print</PRE>
This says:
<OL>
<LI> Take the number 2.
<LI> Take the number 1.
<LI> Add the two things you have and keep the result.
<LI> Take the number 5.
<LI> Multiply the two things you have and keep the result.
<LI> Print everything you have.
</OL>
So this prints the number 15.  Note that we didn't need parenthesis to
distinguish between <TT>(1 + 2)*5</TT> and <TT>1 + (2 * 5)</TT>.
That kind of ambiguity happens only with infix operators.
<P>
Returning to our more complex example:
<PRE>
   "The answer is " x abs 1 + 5 * print</PRE>
what this does is
<OL>
<LI> Take the string "The answer is ".
<LI> Take the value of the variable x.
<LI> Find the absolute value of the thing you have and keep the result.
<LI> Take the number 1.
<LI> Add the two things you have and keep the result.
<LI> Take the number 5.
<LI> Multiply the two things you have and keep the result.
<LI> Print everything you have.
</OL>
Note that we start by taking the string and just hold onto it without operating
on it at all.  The <TT>abs</TT> function operates on the most recent thing
we took, and the <TT>+</TT> and <TT>*</TT> times functions operate on the
two most recent things we took.  So clearly the computer needs to be able
to keep track of a large number of things and their order.
<P>
The data structure used by computer to do this is a <EM>stack</EM>.  It's
just a linear pile of values which allows us to add a value onto the top,
or take a value off the top.  Adding a value is called <EM>pushing</EM> it.
Deleting a value is called <EM>popping</EM> it.
<P>
So we'll run the above command again, this time using stack terminology and
showing the stack after each step.  We'll assume that the value of <TT>x</TT>
is -7 and we'll write the stack with the bottom at the left and the top at
the right:
<TABLE>
<TR><TH COLSPAN=2>Operation</TH><TH>Resulting Stack</TH>
<TR><TD>(1)</TD><TD>Push the string "The answer is ".</TD>
<TD><TT>"The answer is "</TT></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>(2)</TD><TD>Push the value of <TT>x</TT>.</TD>
<TD><TT>"The answer is " -7</TT></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>(3)</TD><TD>Pop a number, push its absolute value.</TD>
<TD><TT>"The answer is " 7</TT></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>(4)</TD><TD>Push 1.</TD>
<TD><TT>"The answer is " 7 1</TT></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>(5)</TD><TD>Pop two numbers, push their sum.</TD>
<TD><TT>"The answer is " 8</TT></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>(6)</TD><TD>Push 5.</TD>
<TD><TT>"The answer is " 8 5</TT></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>(7)</TD><TD>Pop two numbers, push their product.</TD>
<TD><TT>"The answer is " 40</TT></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>(8)</TD><TD>Print everything on the stack from bottom up.</TD>
<TD><EM>empty</EM></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
So the execution of a Backtalk program is really very simple.  Backtalk
starts at the beginning of the program and executes one item at a time
according to the following rules:
<UL>
<LI>If the item is a number or a string, push it on the stack.
<LI>If the item is a variable name, push its value on the stack.
<LI>If the item is a function name, execute it.  It will pop its inputs
    (if any) off the stack and push its result (if any) back.
</UL>
That's pretty much all there is.
This is very simple and computers can run such scripts very quickly.

<H2>3. Backtalk Syntax</H2>

The examples above aren't actually quite in correct Backtalk syntax.
We'll set that straight here.

<H3>3.1. Comments</H3>

First, comments start with percent signs:
<PRE>
    % This is my beautiful program

    1 2 + print   % This should print the number 3</PRE>

<H3>3.2. White Space</H3>

White space doesn't matter.  Occasionally it can be omitted.  All of the
following are equivalent:
<PRE>
    1 2 + print

    1   2
        +
        print

    1 2+print</PRE>

<H3>3.3. Strings</H3>

Since we don't need parenthesis for their usual function of grouping
arguments to operators, we use them instead of quotation marks to quote
strings.  Quoting strings with parenthesis seems a bit odd at least, but
it actually makes things easier to read, since it is clear what is inside
the parenthesis and what is outside.
<P>
So the classic hello world program is:
<PRE>
    (Hello world!\n) print</PRE>
Here '<TT>\n</TT>' represents a newline.  You can also just put a literal
linebreak inside a string.  The following two forms are equivalent:
<PRE>
    (Hello world!\nHow you doing?\n) print

    (Hello world!
    How you doing?
    ) print</PRE>

If you have a parenthesis in a string, you usually need to backslash it:
<PRE>
   (Hello world! \(copyright 1978, Kernighan and Ritchie\)\n) print </PRE>
Actually, in this case you don't have to Backslash the parentheses because
they balance.  But you definately would in the following case:
<PRE>
   (Hello world! \(copyright )
     year
     (, Kernighan and Ritchie\)\n) print </PRE>
Here the parentheses inside each string don't match up, so they must be
backslashed.  In general it is good style to backslash them all.
<P>
You can concatinate strings with the <TT>+</TT> function.
"<TT>(Hello )(World)+</TT>" gives "<TT>(Hello World)</TT>".
Sometimes this gets big and ugly:
<PRE>
  (Hello )(World!)(\n)(How are )(you)(?/n)+++++</PRE>
An alternate syntax is often more convenient:
<PRE>
  ` (Hello )(World!)(\n)(How are )(you)(?/n) '</PRE>
Here everything between the <TT>`</TT> and the <TT>'</TT> will be
concatinated together into a string.  The <TT>`</TT> really just pushes
a mark on the stack, and the <TT>'</TT> is a function that concatinates
everything after the last mark on the stack.

<H3>3.4. Variables</H3>

We can define variable as follows:
<PRE>
   /year 1978 def
   /name (Tom) def </PRE>
When a variable name is proceded by a slash, then the name itself is pushed
on the stack instead of it's value.  So the <TT>def</TT> function pops the
name and a value off the stack and defines that variable to have that value.
We get the value of a variable just by using its name without the slash.
<PRE>
   (My name is )name( and I was born in )year(\n) print</PRE>
<P>
You'll see several other forms of this.
The <TT>xdef</TT> function does that same thing but takes the arguments in
reverse order:
<PRE>
   1978 /year xdef
   (Tom) /name xdef </PRE>
<P>
The <TT>store</TT> and <TT>xstore</TT> functions are similar to <TT>def</TT>
and <TT>xdef</TT> but they can only store new values in previously existing
variables, while <TT>def</TT> can either update or create variables.  In
most Backtalk scripts the difference doesn't matter, but Backtalk does have
a notion of local and global sets of variables that we won't get into here,
and it may matter when those are being used.

<H3>3.5. Constants</H3>

The <TT>defconstant</TT> function looks a lot like <TT>def</TT>:
<PRE>
   /year 1978 defconstant
   /name (Tom) defconstant</PRE>
It behaves very differently though.  All Backtalk scripts are compiled before
being executed, with the compiled copy being saved to a file.  Constants are
evaluated at compile time instead of run time.  So if we write
<PRE>
   (My name is )name( and I was born in )year(\n) print</PRE>
Then the compiler will translate this to:
<PRE>
   (My name is )(Tom)( and I was born in )1978(\n) print</PRE>
This means when we actually run the program Backtalk doesn't have to look
up the values of <TT>name</TT> and <TT>year</TT> because it already has
the values.  In fact, it can't look up those values, because they don't
exist at run time.
This is faster, but it also means that you can't change those values at
run time.  A lot of system configuration settings are done with constants.
<P>
Backtalk will even do some computation on constants at compile time.
If we write:
<PRE>
   /msg `(I was five years old in )year 5 +(\n)' def </PRE>
then the compiled copy of the program will actually do
<PRE>
   /msg (I was five years old in 1983\n) def</PRE>
Here the addition and the concatination could all be done at compile time.
Appropriate use of constants can improve performance significantly.

<H3>3.6. Arrays</H3>

You can define an array in Backtalk by doing
<PRE>
  /weekname [ (Sun) (Mon) (Tue) (Wed) (Thu) (Fri) (Sat) ] def</PRE>
This actually works much the way the concatination operators do -
<TT>[</TT> pushs a mark on the stack, and <TT>]</TT> is a function that
pops things off the stack until it finds a mark, then forms everything it
popped into an array.
Array can contain any mixture of any kind of data, including other arrays.
There are operators to do various normal things with arrays, like
extract particular values, but you most often see them used in Backtalk
to simply group data.  If you print an array, it just prints all the 
elements in it.
So if I want to generate a control panel to be
displayed at the top and the bottom of the screen, I can generate it once,
save it in an array, and print it twice.

<H3>3.7. Procedures</H3>

A procedure is similar to an array, but functions aren't executed in it:
<PRE>
   /addone { 1 + } def</PRE>
The <TT>{ 1 +}</TT> part of this doesn't get executed.  Instead, a special
array is created with the elements <TT>1</TT> and <TT>+</TT>.  The array
becomes the value of the <TT>addone</TT> variable.  Variables whose values
are procedures are special.  If we later do:
<PRE>
   7 addone print</PRE>
Then we don't just push the value of <TT>addone</TT> onto the stack as we
usually would for a variable.  Instead, Backtalk notices that it is a
procedure and executes it.  So the 1 is pushed and the <TT>+</TT>
is executed and we print 8.
This is how new functions are defined in Backtalk.
<P>
Procedures are also used to create conditionals and loops.
Here is a conditional:
<PRE>
   (The value is )
   x 0 lt {
     (negative.)
   } {
     (postive.)
   } ifelse
   (\n) print</PRE>
The <TT>ifelse</TT> takes three values off the stack.  The first is a flag,
and the second two are procedures.  If the flag is a non-zero number or a
non-empty string, it executes the first of the two procedures.  Otherwise
it executes the second.
<P>
There are a number of different loop functions, all of which take a procedure
argument and execute it repeatedly until some condition arises.
<P>
Conditionals interact in a special way with constants.  If I do:
<PRE>
   name constant {
      `(My name is )name(\n)'
   } if</PRE>
Then if <TT>name</TT> is defined as a constant, then the compiler will
produce
<PRE>
   (My name is Tom\n)'</PRE>
but if <TT>name</TT> is not defined, nothing will be generated.  In this
way entire chunks of code can be caused to vanish if they are not needed
in a particular installation.
This is Backtalk's equivalent of a C-language "<TT>#ifdef</TT>".

<H3>3.8. Implicit Print</H3>

When a Backtalk script finishs execution, it automatically does a
<TT>print</TT> causing everything on the stack to be printed from bottom up.
A lot of scripts work by just letting all the stuff they intend to output
pile up on the stack and never do an explicit <TT>print</TT>.
<P>
This has a number of advantages.  One of the odder ones is that you can
put the <EM>name</EM> of a variable on the stack fairly early on, by doing, say
<TT>/number_of_rows</TT>.  Then you can generate a whole page of data,
keeping count of the number of rows of data generate with the
<TT>number_of_rows</TT> varable.  When you finally output the page, when
the <TT>/number_of_rows</TT> literal is printed, it's current value is
substituted in.  This way I can print the count at the top of the page
although I don't know it's value until the bottom of the page.
<P>
For large pages, however, it is generally better to do regular <TT>print</TT>s
calls to keep from using up too much memory, and to allow output to begin
transferring to the user's browser.
