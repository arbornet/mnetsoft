<H2>User Deletion</H2>
Version 1.3.30

<P>
If your Backtalk system is set up so that users log in to Backtalk 
with real Unix accounts, then you can't use Backtalk to delete accounts.
Use the Unix account administration tools instead.
<P>
However, if your system is set up so users log in with Backtalk accounts,
then you can delete these Backtalk user accounts using either
the Pistachio Web interface, or with the command-line "<TT>btrmuser</TT>"
program.
Just follow the following steps.
(The checkboxes below perform no function -
they are just for your convenience.)

<H2>Warning:</H2>

Backtalk doesn't currently check or warn you if you delete the fairwitness
of a conference.
This can be a problem, because if another account is later created with
the same name as the old fairwitness,
then this new user becomes the fairwitness of the conference.
We hope to fix this in a later release.
For now, be careful.

<H2>Deleting Users by using Web Interface's 'Edit User' tool</H2>

This is convenient if you only want to delete one user and
know that user's login name.

<H2>Deleting Users by using Web Interface's 'User List' tool</H2>

This is convenient if you don't know the login names of
the users you want to delete or if you want to delete more than one user.

<FORM>
<OL>
<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Log into the administration account
<P>
See the <A HREF=admin-menu.html>logging in instructions</A>.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox>
Follow the 'List Users' link in the 'User' section of the menu.
<P>
You will get a control panel for doing searches for users.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Select users to list.
<P>
Use the various controls to select which users you want to see.
If you leave the controls in their default setting,
you will get a list of all users.
These controls are very flexible and can list many different subsets of
your users.  You can select them by name, group, registration date,
last login date, or status, or combinations of these.
<P>
Select the "Detailed Information and Edit Buttons" option if you just want
to delete a few users.
Select the "Select for Deletion" option if you want to
delete most of the users you are listing.
<P>
Click the 'Do Scan' button to start your search.
A listing of all selected users will appear below the control panel.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Delete the users.
<P>
If you used the "Detailed Information and Edit Buttons" option, 
find the user you want to delete.  There is a red 'Delete' button
next to each login name.  Click that button for the user you want to delete.
<P>
If you used the "Select for Deletion" option,
go through and <EM>uncheck</EM> all users you <EM>do not</EM> want to delete.
Note that the default is to delete every account listed, and all checkboxes
(expect those for users whose primary group is cfadm) are pre-checked by
default.  When you have only users you want to delete checked, click on the
"Delete Checked Users" button.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Confirm the deletion
<P>
You will be asked if you really want to delete the users you selected.  If
you do, click the "Yes" button.

</OL>

<H2>Deleting Users by using <TT>btrmuser</TT> from Unix</H2>

<OL>
<HR>
<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Log into the Unix conference administration account
<P>
This is the account that owns all the conference files, user database
files, and Backtalk itself.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Run the <TT>btrmuser</TT> command
<P>
If you want to delete the user "<TT>victim</TT>" then issue the following
command:
<PRE>
    btrmuser victim
</PRE>
It will ask you if you really want to delete poor "<TT>victim</TT>", and do
so if you say yes.
<P>
If you want to delete several users, do:
<PRE>
    btrmuser larry curly moe
</PRE>
If you don't want to be asked for if you really want to delete
each user you listed on the command line, do:
<PRE>
    btrmuser -f larry curly moe
</PRE>
