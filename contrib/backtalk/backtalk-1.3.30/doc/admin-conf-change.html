Backtalk conferences can be either open (so anyone can join them) or
closed (so only users on a list maintained by the fairwitness can enter them).
Opening or closing an existing conference can be done either from the
Backtalk web interface or from Unix.
Both procedures are described here.

<H2>Opening or Closing Conferences From Backtalk:</H2>

To open or close a Backtalk conference, follow the following steps.
(The checkboxes below perform no function -
they are just for your convenience.)
<FORM>
<OL>
<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Log into the administration account
<P>
See the <A HREF=admin-menu.html>logging in instructions</A>.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Goto the conference edit page.
<P>
There is a link on the administration page labelled "Edit a Conference".
Click on this.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Specify the conference to be edited.
<P>
You will be shown a form containing one box.
Enter the name of the conference that
you want to edit here and kill the button labeled "Edit It".

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Specify the new conference mode.
<P>
The form that comes up next will include checkboxes for all conference
modes currently supported by Backtalk - currently "open", and various
variations on "closed" and "fishbowl".
Check whichever you want and then click on the "Change Settings" button.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Edit the user list
<P>
If you chose one of the options that allows you to designate which 
particular users or groups of users may access the conference, then you
may want to set up the initial user list (or you may want to leave that
to the fairwitness to do).
<P>
After changing the conference mode, you'll get a screen describing the
new settings, and if the conference requires a user list, there will
be a clickable "Edit this conference's user list" link.  Alternately,
you can use the "Edit a Conference's User List" link on the main administrative
menu.
<P>
Following either of these links will get yo to the "Edit User List" page.
On the top part of the form you will be able to check which of the currently
defined groups of users should be able to access the conference.  On the
Bottom of the page, you will be able to type in login ID's of
individual users who should be able to access it.  Click "Update" to make
your changes.

<HR>

<H2>Opening or Closing Conferences From Unix:</H2>

The procedure from Unix identical to that used
for Picospan or Yapp 2.3 conferences.
<P>
To open or close Backtalk conference, follow the following
steps.
(The checkboxes below perform no function -
they are just for your convenience.)
<FORM>
<OL>
<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Log onto the Unix conference administration account.
<P>
This is the account that owns all the conference files and the backtalk
program itself.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> change directory to conference directory
<P>
Each conference has a directory where all its files are kept.  There is a
pointer to this directory in the <TT>conflist</TT> file.  The location
of the <TT>conflist</TT> file depends on how your system is configured.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Edit the conference <TT>config</TT> file
<P>
Inside the conference directory, you will find (among other things) a
file named <TT>config</TT>.  This is the file we need to edit to open or
close the conference.
A typical <TT>config</TT> file looks like this:
<PRE>
    !&lt;pc02&gt;
    .martian1.cf
    0
    marvin,carter
    0
</PRE>
The fifth line of this contains a numeric code which tells if the conference
is open or closed.  That line may be missing in which case the conference
is open.
There may be some other lines after these.
We need to change the value in the fifth line (or add the line if it doesn't
exist).
<P>
The possible values that can be used here are:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR><TD>0
<TD>all users may read and post [default]
<TR><TD>4
<TD>only users in the ulist or glist may read and post
<TR><TD>5 
<TD>only users who know the password may read or post
<TR><TD>6 
<TD>only users who are in the ulist or glist
and know the password may read or post
<TR><TD>8
<TD>all users may read and post (but item files not directly readable)
<TR><TD>20*
<TD>only users in the ulist or glist may post / all may read
<TR><TD>21*
<TD>only users who know the password may post / all may read
<TR><TD>22*
<TD>only users who are in the ulist or glist and
know the password may post / all may rea
</TABLE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
* Picospan doesn't support fishbowl conferences (though Yapp does),
so if you want to be compatible with Picospan,
modes 20, 21, and 22 are unusable.
<P>
So all you have to do is change the fifth line of the conference
<TT>config</TT> file to one of the other values in this table.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Update the conference
<TT>ulist</TT> and <TT>glist</TT> file
<P>
For conferences with modes 4, 6, 20, or 22 there is a list maintained of
which users may enter the conference.
This is in two files, one named <TT>ulist</TT>, the other name <TT>glist</TT>,
both of which are in the same conference directory as the <TT>config</TT> file.
The <TT>ulist</TT> file simply contains the Backtalk login
names of the users who may join, listed one per line.
Similarly the <TT>glist</TT> file contains the names of Backtalk user groups
who may join, listed one per line.
You can use either or both files.
<P>
If you are opening a formerly closed conference, you may want to delete
these files (though you don't have to).
<P>
If you are closing a formerly open conference, you may want to create them
and edit them to contain initial lists of users and groups.
Or you can just leave it to the fairwitness to do this through the Backtalk
interface.
(Note that the fairwitnesses of a conference can always join a conference
even if they are <EM>not</EM> in the ulist or glist.)

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Change the conference password
<P>
For conferences with modes 5, 6, 21, or 22 there is a password stored in
a file named <TT>secret</TT> in the same conference directory as the
<TT>config</TT> file.
It simply contains the password, stored in plain text.
Obviously, this file should not be read permitted.
<P>
If you are opening a formerly closed conference, you may want to delete
this file (though you don't have to).
<P>
If you are closing a formerly open conference, you may want to create it,
making sure to permit it mode 644.
Or you can just leave it to the fairwitness to do this through the Backtalk
interface (fairwitnesses and conference administrators will see a "Change
Password" button on the conference home page).
If there is no secret file on a conference whose mode is 5, 6, 21, or 22,
then no password will work to get in.
However,
the fairwitnesses of a conference can always join their conference
without giving a password,
so they will be able to get in to set the initial password.
