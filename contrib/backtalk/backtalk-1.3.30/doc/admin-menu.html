Most administrative tasks using the web interface start at the administrative
menu.
Getting there the first time is a bit non-obvious.  Once you are there,
you should bookmark the page, so you can jump directly there in the future.
<P>
The URL of the adminstration page is printed at the end of the install process.
If you didn't note it then, here are some clues for figuring it out (the
exact URL is going to be somewhat installation dependent).
The URL typically looks something like:
<PRE>
   http://your.host.name/cgi-bin/adm/backtalk/admin/begin
</PRE>
One way to figure it out is to log into backtalk as you normally would,
and edit the URL that shows up in your browser's "Location" box.  It will
normally have "/pw/backtalk/" somewhere in the middle.  Replace everything
after the "/backtalk/" with "admin/begin".  Then replace the "/pw/" with
"/adm".  Go there.
<P>
When you goto this URL, you will be asked to login again.  You'll need to
login using an account that has administrative powers.  The install
scripts create one such account, always named "cfadm" and prompts you to
set its password.  We recommend using that, but it is possible to created
more administrative accounts (any account in group 'cfadm' is an administrative
account).
<P>
Note that "adm/backtalk" and "pw/backtalk" are two identical programs in
different locations.  The only function of having two is that it becomes
possible to be logged into two different accounts at the same time, which
is convenient if you suddenly want to do some administrative stuff when
you were already logged into your own account.  Without this, you'd have
to log out of your own account before logging into the administrative account.
Since logging out requires exiting all browser windows, this would be
annoying.
<P>
Once logged in, you should see the administrative menu.
