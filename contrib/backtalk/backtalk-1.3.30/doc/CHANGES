    flavor/scriptname of the script we tried to run.
  - Modify public/relogin.bt and public/login.bt so that when a session
    expires, the normal action is to continue the original query after the
    user has re-logged in.  Also add a "read anonymously" button to the
    relogin form, so people can opt out of logging back in.
  - Add public/logout.bt script, and use that for logging out, so that if the
    session is expired it doesn't force you to login so you can logout.
    Modify pistachio and abalone to use public/logout.bt .
  - Killsession now erases session cookies even if the session has expired
    or if it is called from a public script.

    backfile in many configurations.

Version 1.2.30 - Oct 28, 2003
  - Rewrite several Mysql queries so they don't use subqueries, because, well,
    Mysql doesn't have subqueries.

  - Fixed yet another bug in the fav_sel function, this time relating to
    isels with more than one range beyond the end of the participation file.
  - Fixed 'Goto Conference...' command on abalone resign page.

Version 1.3.10 - Sep 3, 2003
  - Taught HTML scrubber to filter out any Javascript entities.  These
    never worked anywhere except on Netscape, but they are yet another way
    to introduce executable content into HTML text.

Version 1.3.9 - Aug 6, 2003
  - Added documentation of email_new, email_body, email_recip, email_send,
    and email_close to script language reference manual.

Version 1.2.28 - Aug 6, 2003
  - Fixed a problem that may have been responsible for occasional
    misidentifications of users seen on some systems.
  - Added '#include <errnoh.>' to src/readcomp.c and src/adm_user.c.  It seems
    that 'errno' is a macro on some systems.

Version 1.3.8 - Jul 25, 2003
  - Added --with-pwauth configure option, which is only used when you have
    both --login=form and --auth=shadow.  It gives the path name of the
    authenticator to run in that case.
  - Fixed a compile error when used in that configuration.

Version 1.2.27 - Jul 25, 2003
  - Fixed crash in admin/showuser.bt that occured if you had useplan set.

Version 1.2.25 - Jul 17, 2003
  - Fixed a small memory leak in useremail function.

Version 1.3.7 - Jun 29, 2003
  - If Backtalk is built with --with-sendmail option, then Backtalk can send
    email.  The new constant canemail will be true, and the new functions
    email_new, email_body, email_recipient, email_send, and email_close can
    be used to compose and send email messages.  Fairly good MIME support
    is included - we can do attachments and alternate text formats.
  - If email is enabled, then when an account is created Backtalk runs the
    script email/welcome.bt, which sends a "Welcome" message to the new
    user.
  - Rewrote session-id generation code formerly in sess_file.c and sess_sql.c.
    It's now in entropy.c and there are two versions - one uses /dev/urandom,
    the other uses MD5 and an entropy pool stored in etc/bt_entropy.  Session
    IDs are lengthened from 13 to 24 characters, so the format of the session
    files or SQL tables changes.   People upgrading a system using an SQL
    session table will need to run "sqlinit sess" to rebuild the session
    table.
  - Fix segfault when /tmp/bt.rep cannot be created.
  - Fix segfault when CONTENT_TYPE is not defined (mostly happens with
    fronttalk).

Version 1.2.24 - Jun 29, 2003
  - When in direct_exec mode, toggle to running as user when accessing
    participation files, .backtalk file, or any other file in the user's
    home directory.  Kind of important for fronttalk.
  - Configure script complains if you try --enable-exec with non-unix logins.
  - Portability fix to btinstall.in script.

Version 1.2.23 - Jun 22, 2003
  - Fix bug in fav_sel that make "read 3" fail when the single name item was
    not in the user's participation file.

  - Fix bad test syntax in Makefile.in

Version 1.3.6 - Jun 17, 2003
  - Fix some things so that --disable-attachments doesn't cause compilation
    errors.

Version 1.2.21 - Jun 17, 2003
  - Partutil creates participation files with office info clipped off of full
    name.
  - Fixed small typo in script/public/newuser.bt
  - Privacy button on newuser screen no longer loses state after error.
    Default value corrected to be "all users".

Version 1.3.5 - Jun 13, 2003
  - Split confaccess.c out from ps_config.c, so pwauth compiles again.

Version 1.3.4 - May 7, 2003
  - Changed default setting of auto_recompile to 2.  This is probably a
    better setting for most sites.
  - Added email_fromaddr, email_fromname, and email_organization setting
    to backtalk.conf file.
  - Added --with-sendmail option to configure.
  - Other email support is in here, but in a totally incomplete state.

Version 1.2.20 - May  7, 2003
  - Fixed compile error in src/udb.c when building with --login=form option.
  - Fixed non-portable declaration of crypt in src/sess_file.c.
  - More corrections to URLs printed by Makefile when build is complete.
  - Fixed bug in handling of --aspell=/full/path configure option.
  - Modified sess_file.c to avoid negative lseeks() which were giving me
    inexplicable problems on one host.

Version 1.3.3 - Apr 30, 2003
  - Abalone and Pistachio gain tools to add/delete and edit attachments.
  - Print warnings to cfadm users in various places if the secure and
    saverep flags are not set to a safe setting.
  - Teach edit_resp enough about attachments so that it doesn't crash on
    resposnes with attachments.
  - Fixed edit_resp in abalone and pistachio so that it no longer erases
    parent response pointers.
  - Fixed crash when displaying deleted attachments in Abalone.
  - Added edit_attach built-in function to change description or type of
    an attachment.
  - Added reattach built-in function to add, replace or delete attachments
    on a response.

Version 1.2.19 - Apr 29, 2003
  - Fixed wonky permissions on temp file during edit_resp and item_retitle.
  - Fixed admin/reap confirm page so it doesn't croak deletions of really
    large numbers of users.

Version 1.2.18 - Apr 26, 2003
  - For Yapp compatibility, tolerate ulist files with lines terminated by CRNL
    instead of NL.
  - btmkuser command now creates a .backtalk file for the user, with the
    registration date included.  A command line switch is added to enable
    setting random registration dates.
  - dtime function now understands isolated years, like "2003".
  - Blank "results per page" box on Admin "User List" page now stays blank.
  - Bad user list display after deleting single user fixed.
  - Fixed admin/reap script bug that made mass deletions fail if any accounts
    were in authentication database but not identity database.
  - Function userinfo's behavior on deleted or partly deleted accounts changed
    substantially.
  - New file src/partdir.c broken out of ps_part.c.

Version 1.2.17 - Apr 13, 2003
  - For Yapp compatibility, triple up comma at start of a line instead of
    just doubling them Picospan-style.
  - Fixed a bug with link to first item on abalone confhome page.

Version 1.2.16 - Apr 9, 2003
  - Fixed typo in src/Makefile.in
  - Added empty script/lib/biolink.bt file for forwards compatibility.

Version 1.2.15 - Apr 7, 2003
  - Fixed links on bottom of welcome pages for sites with --login=form

Version 1.3.2 - Apr 5, 2003
  - Deleted --enable-debug configure option.  Instead we have runtime
    variables 'saverep' and 'secure' set in config.bt.
  - Added --enable-attachments configuration flag.
  - Implemented attachment archive where attachments to responses can be
    stored.  Added 'get_attach' and 'make_attach' functions.
  - New system variables 'canattach' and 'attachments' added.  'Attachments' is
    an input to post_item and post_resp, and an output from read_resp.
  - 'kill_item' deletes attachments, as does 'erase_resp'.
  - Pistachio and abalone scripts sets updated to support reading and posting
    of attachments.
  - Default timeout in config.bt set to seven minutes.  Would anyone really
    want to wait longer that that for a web page?
  - Support for multipart/form-data POST queries in cgi_query.c.
  - Added cleanattach program, to erase dropped attachments.
  - Added dumpattach program, a diagnostic tool.
  - Total redesign of the way repeat files work.
  - The config.bt script is now run *before* authenticating the user.
  - Added mimename command and misc/mimename file for giving names to mime
    types.
  - cgiquote function quotes control characters.
  - Dictionary dump code handles control characters in strings better.
  - Broke vstr.c out of format.c and substantially rewrote it, making more
    use of realloc() which is sometimes more efficient that malloc() and
    memmove.  Want to use this in several other places.
  - Broke debug.c out of main.c.
  - Attempt to access pages anonymously when no anonymous reading is enabled
    runs public/login.bt instead of public/welcome.bt when sessions are used.

Version 1.2.14 - Apr 5, 2003
  - Fixed bug in handling of control characters in jsquote.
  - Fixed compilation error in hashfile.c when using native GDBM or Old DBM -
    which hardly anyone ever did.
  - Added src/sess_stupid.c for sites that put logins in cookies.  Yech.
    Not tested.
  - Some fixes to configure.in, mainly relating to SQL sites.

Version 1.3.1 - Mar 14, 2003
  - Support for linking to external bio page instead of backtalk bio page
    in abalone interface.
  - Added 'scriptname' system constant.

Version 1.2.13 - Mar 13, 2003
  - Fixed missing abalone jump table in case when no responses where shown.
  - Fixed weird stack underflow crash that occurs when posting items.
 
Version 1.3.0 - Mar 11, 2003
  - Abalone much revised to use cascading style sheets.  css directory added
    to distribution and install scripts modified to install it.
  - Deleted vanilla flavor from the distribution, and made it a separately
    distributed interface.
  - Deleted src/adm.cgi from distribution (hasn't been used for a long time).

Version 1.2.12 - Mar 11, 2003
  - Fixed bug that caused backslashes to accumulate when parenthesis were used
    in full names in Backtalk-style participation files.
  - Added incl/localconfig.h
  - Updated and expanded doc/auth.html.
  - Removed some debug code from empty posting error message.

Version 1.2.11 - Mar 8, 2003
  - Fixed buffer overflow in session.c.

    they are missing.
  - More portable use of ctype functions in format.c
  - Actually got script/public/showopt.bt into the distribution file, where
    it was supposed to have been since 1.2.2
  - Refixed the compiler bug in adm_user.c that was supposed to have been
    fixed in 1.2.10.

Version 1.2.10 - Mar 5, 2003
  - Expand out any HREF="conf:whatever" attributes in tags in HTML postings.
  - Strip out all "onLoad" or "onClick" type attributre from tags in HTML
    postings.
  - Strip out any HREF="javascript:" type attributes from tags in HTML postings.
  - Add to allowed tags list:  <AREA>, <COL>, <COLGROUP>, <DFN>, <LISTING>,
    <MAP>, <MULTICOL>, <SPACER>, <TBODY>, <TFOOT>, <THEAD>, <VAR>
  - No longer allow tag:  <EMBED>
  - Delete all closing tags with no matching opening tag.
  - Delete content of <SCRIPT>...</SCRIPT> tags.
  - In Yapp_format mode, don't put <BR> on the ends of lines in <PRE> type
    environments.
  - In Yapp_format mode, always put a space after inserted <!-- strings.
  - Unhtml converts &QUOT; to " mark.
  - Unhtml treats <DIR> and <MENU> just like <UL>
  - Clickify nntp: and telnet: URLs.
  - Definition of filter macros format_conf, format_item, and format_resp
    changed:  they now return only URL not whole <A> tag.
  - Revised format.c to use tag table built at compile time.  This is in
    src/tags.c with header incl/tagdefs.h being built from it at compile
    time by src/mktagdefs.c.
  - Support for Unix's without strncasecmp()
  - Fixed crash in abalone when opening non-existant conference
  - Fixed compiler errors in version 1.2.9 comp_func.c, adm_user.c, and
    ps_post.c .
  - Fixed segfault when an program crashes before system dictionary is
    initialized.
  - Fixed mishandling of post_log_file constant in version 1.2.9 scripts.

Version 1.1.24 - Mar 5, 2003
  - Fixed incorrect declaration of lmemcmp() in str.h.

Version 1.2.9 - Mar 1, 2003
  - Pistachio and abalone gain ability to display most recent responses on
    begin page and/or on a separate page, if post_log_file is enabled.
  - In abalone and pistachio, if you access a response via the peek script,
    it doesn't necessarily mark the whole item read.  If the unread responses
    before the response can be fit on the same screen, they are included and
    things are marked read as usual.  If there are too many unread things
    before it, then nothing is marked read.  Links to responses from the
    recent response list work the same way.
  - Miscellaneous small cosmetic changes to pistachio entrance page.
  - Added 'post_log_file' system variable.  If defined, 'post_resp' and
    'post_item' call user supplied 'resp_log_format' and 'item_log_format'
    functions to generate lines to log.
  - Created script/lib directory as repository for shared code.  Moved
    userinfo.bt into it.
  - New script/lib/postlog.bt provides definitions for typical
    'resp_log_format' and 'item_log_format' functions.  And
  - New script/lib/readpostlog.bt provides functions for parsing typical post
    log formats.
  - Fixed formatting of "unreadable conference" lines on Abalone begin page.
  - Fixed some flakiness in opening home directory files for anonymous users.
  - Updated doc/auth.html.

Version 1.2.8 - Feb 26, 2003
  - HTML responses now get automatic clickification of various conf: and
    http: things, just like plain text responses do.
  - Yapp compatibility fix:  learn to read conference acl files, which give
    more flexibility in specifying conference read/write access.  (But not
    nearly as much as I'd like.)
  - Yapp compatibility fix:  6th line of conference config file in Yapp is used
    for email addresses.  So if building with YAPP_COMPAT, put conference
    title in seventh line instead of sixth.
  - Yapp compatibility fix:  Modes in conference config files can be specified
    by keyword instead of number.
  - Added ident_yapp identity module.  This is for compatibility with Yapp
    installations that do not use Unix accounts.  Supports case where user
    home directories are owned by the httpd account instead of the cfadm
    account.
  - On pistachio item list page, changed "Current Items" to "Unforgotten
    Items".
  - Fixed a response counting bug in 'count_sel' that came up in some
    situations.  Remember:  $ is infinity, not the last response.
  - Fixed a bug in the abalone spell checking code for lazy HTML responses.
  - Support for mixed-case login ids.
  - newuser function upgraded to be able to create Yapp-style accounts.
  - Various changes to accommodate possibility of email address being in the
    identity database.  Added 'changeemail' and 'useremail' builtins, and
    modified 'newuser' to save email addresses.
  - Added 'tail' function to tail a file.
  - Split 'maypost' variable into 'maypost' and 'mayresp' so permissions to
    post items and responses can be separately controlled.
  - Split 'userlist' variable into 'userlist' and 'grouplist' since with acls
    some conferences have a glist but not a ulist, or vice versa.
  - Added 'acl' file handle for acl file access.
  - Added 'yapp_format' constant, which causes response formats to be handled
    in a strange but web Yapp-compatible mode.
  - Small performance enhancement to formatting of plain responses.
  - Slightly improved parsing of HTML tags for unhtml and cleanhtml functions.
  - Builtin 'in' function generalized to handle literals.

Version 1.1.24 - Feb 26, 2003
  - Fixed crash in ingrouplist function when there is no group file.

Version 1.2.7 - Feb 17, 2003
  - Abalone gets a rather nice spell checker.
  - In abalone, status line messages clarify erase/edit/hide/unseen buttons on
    mouse over.
  - In abalone, pop up a confirmation box if a command is selected while there
    is text in the response box.
  - In abalone, pop boxes for 'Goto Conference..." and "View Responses..."
    are generated directly from Javascript, so they come up faster, without
    having to wait for an http request.  Other popups can be configured to do
    this, but there is an upfront penalty, so it is only useful for commonly
    used pop-ups.
  - In abalone and pistachio, terms for 'unseen', 'erase' and 'hide' may now
    be changed in the config.bt file.  More useful for abalone than pistachio.
  - In abalone, preload values in resprange popup and make them autoclear
    when clicked.
  - Fixed bug with closing of abalone popups that manifested in Mac IE and
    probably other browsers.
  - Fixed bug in abalone where items were not in favorite-first order 
    if you select an item from item list and then do "next item".
  - Added 'jsquote' built-in function, to quote strings Javascript style.
  - Added 'undefconstant' built-in function, to undefine constants.
  - The 'spell_check' built-in function can now optionally return guesses at
    the correct spelling of misspelled words.
  - The 'spell_ignore' system variable was added.  It holds a comma-separated
    list of words the spell checker should not consider misspelled.
  - Fix cgiquote function to also quote ' and " signs.
  - Made a start toward implementing an API interface to the Gnu aspell spell
    checker.  Not yet functional.
  - Fixed "Admin URL" printed by Makefile when building with --login=form
    option.

Version 1.2.6 - Jan 21, 2003
  - Fixed bug in fav_sel function that mishandled $ signs which were not part
    of a range in selectors.

Version 1.1.23 - Jan 13, 2003
  - Fixed grammar in public/welcome.bt
  - Fixed unclosed comment in sess_file.c

Version 1.2.5 - Dec 3, 2002
  - In abalone and pistachio, fixed some bugs that caused pseudonyms to be
    lost when a response slipped in.
  - If reading item ranges like 0-$, ignore the 0 instead of crashing. 
  - Fixed crash when favoring an item after doing a scroll in pistachio.
  - Wrote much more of doc/format.html.
  - Added HTTP_USER_AGENT and HTTP_REFERER to the no-script dump screen.

Version 1.1.22 - Dec 3, 2002
  - Fixed crash in vanilla when attempting to browse unreadable confernces.
  - Fixed peek script so that peek:conf:3:-4 shows last four responses, as
    it should.

Version 1.2.4 - Oct 28, 2002
  - Abalone gets option to turn off automatic submit on pulldown menus.  Opera
    seems not to allow you to select nothing once you've clicked on a pulldown.
  - Fix cgiquote function to also quote # signs.
  - Crash screen includes version number.
  - Fixed crash when anonymously reading conference list in vanilla.

Version 1.1.21 - Oct 14, 2002
  - Fixed "allowgraphics" switch, so that you really can disable images but
    not HTML in a conference.

Version 1.2.3 - Oct 5, 2002
  - Pistachio and abalone gain favor/disfavor buttons on read page.
  - Pistachio and abalone item lists include "favorite" tags and put favorite
    items first.
  - Pistachio and abalone read commands show favorite items first.
  - Pistachio and abalone users can configure auto-favor for posting items
    and responses.
  - Pistachio and abalone allow users to set their own item titles.
  - Read button on pistachio "item list" page now offers more item ordering
    options.
  - Default item ordering can be configured in pistachio on a per conference
    basis.
  - Pistachio config file now allows you to set background images, and
    text and highlight colors.
  - Fairwitnesses can now set background images and highlight colors for
    their conferences in Pistachio.
  - Pistachio gains option to allow users to set colors and buttons and
    background images on a per-conference basis.
  - Pistachio "next item" logic modified slightly, so that double-clicking
    the button doesn't cause new responses from the next page to vanish.
    Ditto for "read new" button.
  - Internal links can use . or : as delimiters, like conf:general.3.34
    or item:test:102.  This improves compatibility with various other
    conferencing systems.
  - Ability to read/write alternate participation files enabled and much
    debugged.
  - Partutil extended to handle participation extension files.
  - Added favorite support in interpretor:  fav_sel function to move
    favorites to front of an item selector and rfav and ifav variables to
    control if items become favorites when responded to or posted to.
  - Added jointomark function to interpretor.
  - When running in hide_html mode, strip meta-characters out of all plain
    text versions of responses, including both those entered as plain text
    and those entered as HTML.  Some browsers generate them, and command-
    line users don't want to see them.

    conferences instead of your list of hotlist conferences.
  - Fixed crash in abalone preferences setting on systems with unix accounts.
  - Fixed erroneous csels when entering an abalone conference by clicking on
    it's name in the hotlist.
  - Pistachio gets some anchor tags, not used for anything.
  - Don't attempt to run partutil if executing directly.
  - Give partutil an friendlier and more informative error message.
  - Set default script timeout to a more conservative value.

Version 1.1.20 - Oct 5, 2002
  - More portable declaration of memchr() in snprintf.c

Version 1.1.19 - Sep 20, 2002
  - Fixed bug in checking access to glisted unix conferences.
  - Correction to Unix install instructions.
  - Configure script fixed for compatibility with SunOS 4 version of sh.
  - Fixed memory leaks in read_text, ogrep, sgrep, undef and inlist functions.

Version 1.2.2 - Sep 9, 2002
  - Performance improvements to code for scanning in-memory copy of user's
    participation file.
  - Added 'serverurl' and 'backtalkurl' functions, to get URL of scripts
    more accurately (especially with respect to deciding if we are under
    http  or https).  Pistachio, abalone, vanilla, public and admin interfaces
    modified to make proper use of these constructs.
  - Abalone "Resign Conference" command gets pop confirmation box.
  - Abalone gets "Goto Conference..." options on all pulldown menus.  These
    prompt for the conference names in popup boxes.
  - Abalone search page gains item range box.
  - Abalone item list flags retired and linked items.  Multiple state icons
    displayed for items with multiple settings.
  - Abalone confhome page gets checkboxes on each listed item.  "Read new", 
    "Read all", and "search" commands restrict to check items if any are
    checked.  Versions of "forget" and "remember" that act on all checked
    items added.
  - Abalone read page gets response range command with popup box.  The respond
    command on the pulldown now uses a popup to prompt for the response.
  - Abalone gets fairwitness commands:  link, retire, unretire, freeze, thaw,
    delete on confhome page.  retitle, retire, unretire, freeze, thaw, delete
    on read page.  Can edit conference settings, change conference password,
    and edit ulist.
  - Abalone can change password from preferences screen.
  - Abalone catches slipped in responses, allowing you to edit and repost, if
    you like.
  - Abalone gets help pages in most places.
  - External location redirects used in various places in Abalone and Pistachio
    to ensure that "reload" operations don't repeat operations.
  - Added script/public/showopt.bt which allows the backtalk configuration to
    be viewed over the web.
  - Backtalk -r repeat function upgraded to handle arbitrarily long query
    strings.
  - Can read and write several alternate participation file formats - plain
    old picospan, a new tag-based format, or a picospan file with a parallel
    tag file to store extra fields in.  This gives us the capability to store
    arbitrary per-user/per-conference and per-user/per-item settings.  However,
    it is mostly disabled in this release, since the extensions have not been
    fully tested.
  - Added get_conf_note, get_item_note, set_conf_note, and set_item_note
    commands to access extra particiption file fields.
  - misc/Makefile.in becomes more careful about not clobbering installed copy
    of backtalk.conf.

Version 1.1.18 - Sep 9, 2002

  - Fixed bug that caused Abalone to show wrong response when you view
    hidden responses.
  - Fixed infinite loop on unclosed <!-- HTML comments.

Version 1.2.1 - Aug 25, 2002
  - Small improvements to abalone's conference list and hotlist editing.
  - Small bug fixes to admin tool for editing hotlists.
  - Added dictionaries as a first class data type.
  - Changed syntax of 'begin' function.
  - Added 'dict' function.
  - Internally, all dictionaries now use a true hash search instead of binary
    search.
  - 'length' function extended to work on dictionaries.
  - 'get' function extended to work on dictionaries and strings.
  - 'put' function extended to work on dictionaries, but not strings.  Making
    it work on strings will require major revisions to the handling fo strings.
  - Added 'cflist_array' function to load conference hotlist into an array.
  - Parsing of .cflist moved from scripts into C code.
  - Can now read .cflists with more than one conference per line (though we
    never write them that way.
  - Added 'known' function to test if variable is in a dictionary.
  - added 'newbie' flag, which is set when a user joins a conference for the
    very first time.  Darn, why didn't I call it 'virgin'?
  - New blue color scheme for abalone (contributed by Tony Publinski).
  - Can tolerate conference participation files with missing fairwitness and
    time limit lines.
  - getput.c file added to source.
  - src/sysdict.c is now generated by src/mksysdict.c .
  - Fixed bug in 'cvn' functions - literals it generated where searched for
    in user dictionaries before system dictionary.
  - Broke token deallocation functions out from src/stack.c to src/free.c .
  - Added ps_cflist.c file.
  - Added first draft of doc/format.html.

    conference listed on the begin page.
  - Added 'snoop_conf' function to open conferences for snooping.
  - Fixed a memory management bug in 'put' function.
  - Fixed quoting of user names on pistachio participant page.
  - Fixed order of head/title tags on pistachio read page.

Version 1.2.0 - Aug 8, 2002

    Tony Publinski for help with Yapp 3.0 file formats and testing).
  - Added --with-yapp3 configuration option.
  - Generalized support for public.txt files, allowing you to configure
    regular expressions to parse your favorite local format.
  - Added 'pathname' function to convert filehandles to full paths.
  - Bio scripts use 'pathname' to construct paths to other user's .backtalk
    and .plan files instead of doing it manually.

Version 1.1.15 - Aug 8, 2002
  - Fixed Newuser URL printed out by Makefile.
  - Fixed crash when entering interfaces from welcome page when anonymous
    reading is disabled.
  - Fixed crash on abalone preferences screen.

Version 1.1.14 - Jun 27, 2002
  - Various tiny documentation fixes.

Version 1.1.13 - Jun 26, 2002
  - Fix configure scripts to accept URL with https: prefixes.
  - In abalone, after jumping into the middle of the list of active conferencess
    on the entrance page or the list of new items on the confhome page, then
    the next conference and next item commands act just like a normal 'read
    new'.  Previously the worked weirdly or not at all.
  - Fix compile time error in showopt.c for people who oddly define YAPP_COMPAT
    or PICOSPAN_COMPAT but not PARTUTIL.
  - Abalone navigation pulldowns now have Javascript to make them automatically
    execute without pushing the go buttton.

Version 1.1.12 - Feb 12, 2002
  - Words like 'Fairwitness' and 'Conference' now configurable in Abalone.
  - Fixed bugs in permission checking for retitle, hide, erase.

    and response text in pistachio and abalone.
  - Some abalone scripts made more tolerant of missing parameters.

Version 1.1.11 - Feb 6, 2002
  - Added tutorial document.
  - Updated location of Backtalk homepage in documentation.
  - Fixed config script's failure to find cpp on some machines.
  - Admin interface has a config setting to tell which regular interface to
    jump into when you click on a conference name, breaking last dependency
    on Pistachio.
  - Small fixes to byte order detection code.
  - Fixed a bad link on admin/editmenu.bt.

Version 1.1.10 - Feb 2, 2002
  - Implementated mysql support.
  - Abalone gains ability to change user's conference names.
  - Added 'sleep' function.
  - Added 'check_partic' function.
  - Finished implementation of sql session table option.
  - Configure script does a better job of noticing if you specify a owner-id
    or httpd-id that does not exist.
  - 'Make install-binaries' creates cgidir if it doesn't already exist.
  - Finished writing doc/auth.html guide to custom authentication systems.
  - Fixed many bugs in SQL support.
  - Fixed bug with quoting in edit pages for pistachio and abalone.
  - Fixed bug that caused erase_resp to seg fault when censored log was
    unwritable.
  - Fixed pistachio/editform.bt to use explicitly non-wrapping textareas for
    better behavior on IE.
  - Fixed core dump in sqlinit.
  - Rationalization of usage of CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables in 
    src/Makefile.in
  - Added WRAP=OFF to TEXTAREA tags when editing files.
  - Added CSS stuff in headers of pages with TEXTAREAs to try to force
    monospaced fonts in textareas.
  - Added doc/admin-menu.html to distribution, which had been accidentally
    omitted since it was written oh these many years ago.
  - Improve lynx compatibility of html install documentation pages.
  - Flag -session=form added as synonym for -session=cookie.

Version 1.1.9 - Jan 17, 2002
  - Bug fix to in_sel function, which wasn't returning a value when given a
    non-numeric selector.
  - conf_alias function clips names with newlines at the newline instead of
    rejecting them.
  - put command now grows array if you store a value past the end.
  - Correct documentation of link_item command.

Version 1.1.8 - Jan 2, 2002
  - Pistachio item list includes name/id of item author.
  - Added motd.html to file handle list.
  - Pistachio's formatting of the /etc/motd file improved and support for the
    bbs/motd.html file added.
  - Added motd display stuff to abalone.
  - Added locking to transaction logs.
  - Retitle command strips leading spaces and fails on blank title.

Version 1.1.7 - Nov 28, 2001
  - Total reorganization of authentication database and identity database
    code, putting code for each type of database in a separate file, so that
    new database types can easily be added.
  - The --auth= and --ident= configure flags now can be used to pull in
    custom authentication and identification modules written by the installer.
  - Elimination of dynamically loaded usradm and grpadm modules which used to
    contain user and group creation and editing functions.  Dividing things
    up by database type rather precluded dividing things up by operation type,
    so this code is now always linked in.  So the whole -dynaload option,
    which never made that much sense in the first place, makes even less now.
  - SQL interface provided through sql_pgsql.c, sql_mysql.c, sql_msql.c etc.
  - mksql program compiles SQL query templates from the sql/<server>
    directories into sqlqry.c, which is compiled into various programs that
    need to be able to do SQL queries.
  - Support for optional SQL authentication databases provided by auth_sql.c
    module, and support for SQL idnetity database through ident_sql.c module.
  - Broke next_uid() out of udb.c into nextuid.c and added an alternate version
    that uses SQL sequences instead of a file.  This is used if an SQL
    identity database is used.
  - Added sqlinit program for automatic creation of initial database tables.
  - Added backtalk.conf configuration file for some runtime configuration
    settings that don't make sense in config.bt because (1) some of the
    programs that need them don't have a backtalk interpretor built in, and
    (2) some of the data is sensitive and should not be stored in insecure
    backtalk variables.  For now this is mainly SQL server configuration
    information.
  - Resumed work on the session ID code originally written for version 0.9.2.
    Config flag --login=cookies compiles it in.  Added new system constant
    sessions (true if we are using session), and expire_session which gives
    number of seconds between requests before sessions expire.
  - Pistachio, Abalone, and Vanilla gain logout buttons when built with
    sessions.  Login links are also fixed.
  - Scripts in the public directory no longer even try to authenticate the
    user when they are run.  They are always run anonymously.
  - The --disable-edituser flag can be invoked to build a system without
    user editing.
  - More appropriate menu options for anonymous users in Abalone.
  - Dropped support for systems with neither stdarg.h nor varargs.h.  So much
    of Backtalk requires ANSI C that it is hardly useful to bend over backwards
    to support pre-ANSI C in this one instance, and it was starting to get in
    the way.  We continue to support varargs.h, although doing so is likely a
    waste of energy.
  - Added Mark Martinec's portable snprintf() functions to the distribution,
    and did some other fiddling so that we have vprintf(), vfprintf(),
    snprintf(), vsnprint(), asprintf() and vasprintf() on all platforms.
    However vsprintf(), asnprintf(), and vasnprintf() are not supported.
  - Backtalk 'newgroup' command no longer takes list of members as an argument.
    We never used this feature, and it was clumsy to implement in group
    modules.
  - Fixed 'More Matches' link in the admin/listusers.bt to correctly propagate
    forward current search settings.
  - Fixed some array overflow bugs in userinfo.bt.
  - Fixed some stray characters printed by userinfo.bt when user has
    no .backtalk file.
  - Fixed error handling in admin/changeuser.bt script.
  - Fixed various bugs in abalone's listing of hotlist conferences.
  - For pistachio and abalone, if you view your own bio by clicking on a
    login on a response, we default to not giving an edit form right away.
    Instead you get the same display as other users, only with an edit button.
  - Fixed 'quote' command to also convert " to &quot;
  - Fixed / division command.
  - If building with ID_GETUID and another ID_ option, -d switch on command
    line forces use of getuid() to identify user.
  - Improved parsing of public.txt files in pistachio, abalone, and vanilla.
  - Added "forget" and "remember" commands to read page of abalone interface.
    How did I forget forget?
  - Opening the conference name '?' now gets you the default conference.
  - Detect and configure for systems without random().
  - Improved generation of salt for password encryption.
  - Don't use 'userinfo.bt' file on systems with /useplan defined.
  - Added "conf_dir" command which returns conference directory name without
    opening conference.
  - Backtalk interpretor gets -v flag, that causes it just to print out its
    version and configuration.  The showopt built-in command does the same
    thing.
  - Added "last_in_conf" command that returns the time you were last in a
    conference, if you ever were.  This is for deciding whether to display
    bulletins and such.
  - Added "cache_conflist" command which causes the conflist to be cached in
    memory, for use on page with a lot of conference lookups.  Abalone and
    pistachio modified to use this.
  - Added "in" command to test if an array contains a given value.
  - Conf_new command now also returns the number of unseen responses.
  - Added file handles for .cfonce, .cfrc and for system and conference rc
    and welcome files.
  - Setting new global constant "editfrozen" enables hide, show, erase,
    retitle and edit of responses in frozen items.

Version 1.1.6 - Oct  1, 2001
  - Fixed some minor compilation bugs.

Version 1.1.5 - Jun 18, 2001
  - Added missing help page for the pistachio participants page.
  - Added lots more <BASE> directives to help out browsers that are bad at
    following relative URLs.
  - Added 'favicon' system variable.  Taught Backtalk to ignore requests for
    scripts named 'favicon.ico' unless this variable is set.  If it is set
    respond by sending the file whose path is given.
  - Fixed crash when there are trailing slashes on the URL.  We ignore them.
  - Fixed crash that occured when abalone attempted to read a non-existant
    item.
  - If the script name given refers to a directory, then execute the 'begin'
    script in that directory.
  - Added top-level 'begin' script which runs the begin script of whichever
    interface best fits your browser.
  - If a newline is given in an item title, convert it to a space instead of
    crashing.
  - Recognizes and properly flags Picospan "sync" items when rebuilding sum
    files.  Backtalk doesn't do anything with these, but need to flag them
    correctly for Picospan compatibility.
  - Shorter, less obsequious crash screen and dump for bad script names.
    These are too commonly the result of silly users and broken browsers to
    give the full treatment.
  - Fixed crash when you don't enter a pattern on pistachio/findform.
  - Fixed crash on vanilla user search page.
  - Added 'dumpsum' program to distribution.  This just generates a human
    readable dump of a binary sum file.
  - Added 'sumcheck' program to distribution.  This checks sum files against
    the conference directory, and either reports or repairs errors.  Can also
    generate new sum files.
  - Fixed a compile time error when compiling without the SPELLCHECK option.
 
Version 1.1.4 - Jan 24, 2001
  - Added btinstall script as tool for installing separately distributed
    interfaces.
  - Fixed broken pistachio 'Edit User List' button.

Version 1.0.9 - Jan 24, 2001
  - Converted from shareware to GPL freeware.
  - Fixed some bugs in scripts for the creation and use of passworded
    conferences.
  - Fixed open_conf function to set 'secret' variable correctly for conferences
    that are both ulisted and passworded.
  - Fixed a inconsistancy how pistachio/begin and pistachio/optform think
    the summary option defaults when not defined.

Version 1.1.3 - Jan 21, 2001
  - Added minimal spell checking into pistachio 'preview' pages.  I'd like to
    improve this later.
  - Added 'spellcheck' function, 'canspell' constant, and 'spell_lang'
    system variable.
  - Added --with-ispell configure option.
  - Revised the way logo images are defined, allowing two different image
    definitions.
  - Fixed lack of stickiness of --with-picospan and --with-yapp configure
    options.
  - Fixed site name error in public/newuser.bt script.

Version 1.0.8 - Jan 21, 2001
  - Fixed a bug that could cause the last tag in an HTML response to disappear.
  - HTML sanitizer now insists that <TABLE> <TR> and <TD> tags be properly
    nested and properly closed.

Version 1.1.2 - Jan 11, 2001
  - Added support for group file, identifying administrators based on their
    group assignment.  Added 'groups', 'ingroup', 'groupid', 'groupname' and
    'dfltgroup' group info request commands and 'newgroup', 'newgroupmem',
    'delgroup', 'delgroupmem' and 'changegroup' administrative commands.
  - New 'newuser' built-in backtalk command obsoletes the makeacct program.
    The 'makeacct' program is dropped from the distribution.
  - New 'new_conf' and 'del_conf' built-in commands obsolete the 'confutil'
    program.  The 'confutil' program is dropped from the distribution.
  - Also dropped the 'linkconf' program which has been obsolete for a hundred
    years or so.
  - Account creation can now be done by members of the 'gradm' group,
    even if we have ONLY_ADM_CREATE set.  Such accounts can be created only
    in the groups the 'gradm' user is a member of (but not in group 'gradm').
    Members of this group can also change passwords, and fullnames and
    delete accounts which are in their primary group.
  - Backtalk can now be built either as a single binary, or as a core binary
    which doesn't have the more rarely used functions compiled in.  Instead
    it loads these on demand from special shared library files.  Rolled stuff
    from Gnu's libtool package into the distribution to support this
    somewhat portably.
  - Added userinfo.bt script on top level which allows the set of questions
    asked of newuser to be customized from site to site.  Modified pistachio,
    vanilla, and abalone bio.bt and changebio.bt scripts to use this too.
  - Anonymous users can now always run any script in the 'public' script
    directory, not just the 'welcome' script.
  - New admin version of the newuser page allows creation of accounts in 
    arbitrary groups.
  - New admin version of user search page allows much more sophisticated
    queries.
  - New Admin user listing pages, with many new options, including mass
    deletion of accounts selected by various criteria.
  - Admin interface completely severed from pistachio interface.  Admin
    pages have more cross links so 'back' button isn't needed as much.
  - Added 'glist' file, which is like a conference ulist file, but lists
    groups of users who can access the conference.  Added ability to edit
    glist file to pistachio.  Add (*glist) file handle.
  - Added newuseropen flag, which can be set in the configuration file to
    control whether unauthenticated users are allowed to create themselves
    accounts, and determine whether those accounts are validated.
  - .cflist and dflt.cflist can contain (1) comment lines starting with
    # signs which some interfaces may print as headings in your conference
    hot list, (2) tag lines starting with (#:) which some interfaces may
    use and placemarks in conferences hot lists and (3) conference names
    like kids:barney or 121:barney, where the first part is a group name
    or ID, and the second is a conference name.  The conference is only
    "on the list" if you are in that group.
  - Added anonymity, mayseealias, mayseefname flags which allow hiding of
    user names from unauthenticated users, or from all users.  Modifications
    to vanilla, pistachio, and abalone to support this reasonably cleanly.
  - In pistachio, whether the 'item list' button lists all items or only
    new items by default is now configurable both by the installer and
    each user.
  - New 'loginlen' command returns maximum number of char in login ids.
  - New 'split' command slices a string into all of its words.
  - The 'dont_sort' configuration option is moved to the system-level
    config.bt file, and renamed 'many_users'.
  - The 'dtime' command now takes things like 'beginning of last tuesday' or
    'end of next tuesday' so that you can override the default past/future
    start/end interpretation.  Also unqualified 'the beginning' or 'the end'
    gives start and end of time.
  - New 'chomp' command strips trailing newlines off a string (ala Perl).
  - Added 'cgiquery' variable which returns original query string.
  - Display date/time on crash screen.
  - Fixed crashs in admin/editmenu.bt and admin/editalias scripts.
  - Split user.c into user.c and userfunc.c
  - Bug fixes to searching in vanilla.
  - Minor fixes to preconditions in src/Makefile.
  - Fixed bomb in 'unseen' link in abalone.
  - Fix some warning messages that appear on machines with 64-bit OpenBSD
    machines.

Version 1.0.7 - Jan 11, 2001
  - Fixed minor bug in code to recognizing retired items immediately after
    a sum file has been deleted.
  - Fixed some rarely exercised bugs in reading item status in view.bt and
    edit.bt for all interfaces.
  - Corrections to documentation for read_resp command.

Version 1.0.6 - Jan  7, 2001
  - Fixed several bugs in 'dtime' string-to-time conversion function.

Version 1.0.5 - Dec 29, 2000

    into one string.
  - Implement firstin() and firstout() with strcspn() and strspn() when they
    exist.
  - New browser class -1 introduced for email address collection robots and
    other annoyances.  peek.bt, welcome.bt, pistachio/bio.bt and vanilla/bio.bt

  - Fixed a genuine Y2K bug in routines that convert strings to dates.
    This effected only the dates "yesterday", "today" and "tommorrow".

    script directory to get descriptions of installed interfaces.  New
    peekconf.bt and peekresp.bt scripts in each flavor provide standardized
    entry points for peek.  These changes allow interfaces to easily be
    distributed as separate packages from Backtalk.
  - Minor lynx compatibility fixes to welcome.bt script.

    author's powers to erase and hide.
  - Fixed bug that caused fullname changes to appear to lag in some
    configurations.
  - Added READABLE_PASSWD define for suexec compatiblity.
  - Added response editing command 'edit_resp' and associated variables

    the whole binary file and bombs instead of leaving a partial one around.
  - When posting items or responses, check for full disk errors and don't
    post any part of the item or response if there isn't space for all of it.

12/ 8/96 - Read Since, and paging.
11/12/96 - Color setting in Pistachio.
10/17/96 - No-frames mode in Pistachio.

Backtalk had its roots in two programs developed by the authors
independently.  Steve Weiss's WebSpan program, written in 1996, was a
simple read-only web interface to Picospan conferences.  Jan Wolter's
bbsread program was a slightly more complex text-based read-only
interface to Picospan that was written in 1993.
