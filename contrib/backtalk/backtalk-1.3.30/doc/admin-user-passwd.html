<P>
If your Backtalk system is set up so that users use use real Unix login ids
to log into Backtalk, then you won't be able to change their passwords with
Backtalk.  You should use the Unix ``<TT>passwd</TT>'' command instead.
<P>
However, if you system is set up to only use Backtalk accounts, then
system administrators can change the passwords on other user's
Backtalk accounts using either the Pistachio Web interface or
the <TT>btpasswd</TT> command.
Just follow the following steps.
