<HR>
The first step in installing Backtalk is to configure the programs.
To do this, you unpack the distribution, <TT>cd</TT> into the distribution
directory and do:
<P>
<TABLE WIDTH=100% BORDER=1><TR><TD>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<TT>./configure</TT> <EM>&lt;options&gt;</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
<STRONG><FONT COLOR=red>NOTE:</FONT></STRONG>
<OL>
<LI><STRONG><FONT COLOR=red>You'll almost certainly need some options on
    the configure command.</FONT></STRONG>
    <BR>
    Most options have default values appropriate for a simple installation
    using Backtalk accounts, but most installers will want to change at least
    some of them.  It is possible that running <TT>configure</TT> without
    options will work for you, but you should scan the option list below to
    make sure there is nothing there you need.  A summary of options can be
    printed by doing "<TT>./configure --help</TT>".<P>

<LI><STRONG><FONT COLOR=red>Backtalk's configure option flags work
    differently than most configure scripts.</FONT></STRONG>
    <BR>
    The default flag values apply only to the first time you run
    <TT>configure</TT>.  Later, the defaults are whatever value the flag had
    on the previous run.  Thus, if you want to change just one option flag,
    you can rerun <TT>configure</TT> giving just the option to change.
    Everything else will retain it's previous value.
    If you want to start over from a clean slate, remove the
    <TT>config.cache</TT> file before rerunning <TT>configure</TT>.
</OL>
A few options have no default values.  If you don't
specify them, the <TT>configure</TT> script will prompt you for values on
the first run.  On later runs the default values are the values you gave on
the first run, so won't be prompted again.  To change them, either give
the flag, or remove the <TT>config.cache</TT> file.

<H3>"Mandatory" Options</H3>

A few options do not have default values, since the correct values vary too
much between systems, and they are too difficult to automatically detect in
any reliable fashion.
<FONT COLOR=RED>If you do not specify values for these options on
the <TT>configure</TT> command and there are no cached values from a previous
run, then you will be prompted for values.</FONT>

<DL>
<DT><TT>--htmldir=</TT><EM>&lt;path&gt;</EM><BR>
    <TT>--htmlurl=</TT><EM>&lt;url&gt;</EM>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>HTML Directory and URL.</STRONG><BR>
    Backtalk uses several <TT>.html</TT> files that need to be accessible over
    the web.  You need to specify the full path name of the directory in which
    they are installed, and the full URL of that directory.
    <P>
    For example, if you are installing Backtalk under
    the system's document root, you might
    specify:
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <TT>--htmldir=/usr/local/apache/htdocs/backtalk</TT><BR>
        <TT>--htmlurl=http://my.system.com/backtalk</TT>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    or if you are installing Backtalk under
    a user account on the system, you might specify:
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <TT>--htmldir=/home/mylogin/public_html/backtalk</TT><BR>
        <TT>--htmlurl=http://my.system.com/~mylogin/backtalk</TT>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
    Note that <TT>--htmldir</TT> must always begin with a slash, and
    <TT>--htmlurl</TT> must always begin with "<TT>http://</TT>" or
    "<TT>https://</TT>".
<P>
<DT><TT>--cgidir=</TT><EM>&lt;path&gt;</EM><BR>
    <TT>--cgiurl=</TT><EM>&lt;url&gt;</EM>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>CGI-Bin Directory and URL.</STRONG><BR>
    Backtalk uses many cgi-bin programs that must be installed where they
    can be executed by the web server.  You need to specify the full path name
    of the cgi-bin directory to use and the full URL of that directory.
    <P>
    For example, if you are installing Backtalk into the system's
    cgi-bin directory, you might specify:
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <TT>--cgidir=/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/backtalk</TT><BR>
        <TT>--cgiurl=http://my.system.com/cgi-bin/backtalk</TT>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>
    Some systems are set up so that CGI programs can be installed in the
    same directories as HTML documents, with the CGI programs being identified
    by a file-name suffix like <TT>.cgi</TT>.  In such cases your
    <TT>--cgidir</TT> and <TT>--cgiurl</TT> values may be the same as your
    <TT>--htmldir</TT> and <TT>--htmlurl</TT> values, but you should also set
    the <TT>--cgi-suffix=.cgi</TT> option, as described below.
    <P>
    Note that <TT>--cgidir</TT> must always begin with a slash, and
    <TT>--cgiurl</TT> must always begin with "<TT>http://</TT>" or
    "<TT>https://</TT>".
<P>
<DT><TT>--httpd-id=</TT><EM>&lt;id&gt;</EM>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>User HTTP Server Runs As.</STRONG><BR>
    The HTTP server on your system runs as some particular user.  Backtalk
    needs to know what user that is so that it can check that is it really
    being run by HTTP server, and so that authentication databases can be
    set up to be readable only by the HTTP server.
    <P>
    On many systems, the HTTP server runs as "nobody" (though we think it is
    better to set up a separate account called "www" or "http" for the HTTP
    server to run as).
    If you are running Apache, you can find out what user it is running as
    by looking at the <TT>User</TT> option in the Apache configuration files.
    Alternately you could do a <TT>ps</TT> and note what login most
    <TT>httpd</TT> processes are running as (there may be one running as
    'root' - ignore it).
    <P>
    Note that if your CGI's will be running under 'suexec' or some other
    wrapper that causes them to be run by the owner of the file, then this
    should be the owner of the files, exactly the same value as the owner-id
    below.
    <P>
    You can specify the id number either by UID number, or by login name,
    like:
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <TT>--httpd-id=65534</TT>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    or
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <TT>--httpd-id=nobody</TT>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    Note that if you give the login name rather than the uid number, then
    the <TT>configure</TT> script needs to convert the name to a number.  It is
    fairly clever about figuring out how to do this on most Unix systems, but
    if you are building a binary to be run on some other system, a conversion
    based on your build system's password database may not be correct.  Use
    uid numbers in such cases.
<P>
<DT><TT>--owner-id=</TT><EM>&lt;id&gt;</EM>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>User Backtalk Should Run As.</STRONG><BR>
    Ideally you should create a new Unix account for Backtalk to run under.
    All the conference files will be owned by this user, and Backtalk
    processes will (mostly) run as this user.  We suggest that the name
    "<TT>backtalk</TT>" be used for this account, but 
    "<TT>cfadm</TT>" is traditional for Picospan and Yapp systems.
    <P>
    It would be unwise to use <TT>root</TT> for this.  Anything else is
    OK, though an account used for nothing else is best.
    <P>
    It can be set to the same value as <TT>--httpd-id</TT>.
    If you are running under <TT>suexec</TT> it must be the same.
    However, doing this in a non-<TT>suexec</TT> environment
    may weaken Backtalk's security since this would allow all cgi programs
    on your system to access the conference and user databases.
    <P>
    You can specify the id number either by UID number, or by login name,
    like:
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <TT>--owner-id=406</TT>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    or
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <TT>--owner-id=backtalk</TT>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    If you use the second form, the account must exist, so that the
    <TT>configure</TT> script can figure out its UID number.
    It is fairly clever about figuring out how to find the UID number
    on most Unix systems, but if you are building a binary to be run on
    some other system, a conversion based on your build system's password
    database may not be correct.  Use uid numbers in such cases.
<P>
<DT><TT>--owner-group=</TT><EM>&lt;id&gt;</EM>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>Group Backtalk Should Run As.</STRONG><BR>
    This is only needed if you are using Unix login ids with Backtalk, in
    which case a new group should be created for Backtalk to run in.  Nothing
    else should be in this group, as all user's participation files will be
    readable and writable to this group.  It would be reasonable to give the
    group the same name as the owner account.
    <P>
    You can enter either the group name or group id number.  Names will be
    converted to numbers by looking them out in the system's group database.
<P>
<DT><TT>--admin-group=</TT><EM>&lt;id&gt;</EM>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>Group Backtalk Admin Accounts will be in.</STRONG><BR>
    This is only needed if you are using Unix login ids with Backtalk, in
    which case it should be the GID number or name of a unix group.  All
    Unix accounts in this group will have conference administration rights,
    and will be able to create, destroy and reconfigure conferences through
    the web interface, and will function as fairwitnesses in all conferences.
    <P>
    Command-line admin tools can be used only from the account defined by
    the 'owner_id' flag.
</DL>

<H3>Directory Structure Options</H3>

There is a set of options to tell the system what to install where.
Most users will find is sufficient to just use <TT>--prefix</TT> to set
a root directory for Backtalk, and just let the rest default.  However, you
can set each directory individually.
<P>
The first two are just prefixes that are used in the default values for
the others:

<DL>
<DT><TT>--prefix=</TT><EM>&lt;prefix&gt;</EM>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>Architecture-Independent Directory Prefix.</STRONG>
Default= /usr/local/backtalk<BR>
Install all architecture-independent files under this (like conference
data files, scripts and configuration files).
<P>
<DT><TT>--exec-prefix=</TT><EM>&lt;exec-prefix&gt;</EM>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>Architecture-Dependent Directory Prefix.</STRONG>
Default= <EM>&lt;prefix&gt;</EM><BR>
Install all architecture-Dependent files (like executable binaries)
under this.
</DL>
<P>
The rest of the directory options designate specific directories where
Backtalk files are installed, as outlined in the following table:

<H3>Other Backtalk Configuration Options</H3>

The rest of the <TT>configure</TT> options have default values that may well
work just fine for you.

<DL>
<DT><TT>--cgi-suffix=</TT><EM>&lt;suffix&gt;</EM>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>CGI Filename Suffix.</STRONG>  Default= null<BR>
    This is a suffix to be appended to the names of all CGI program
    filenames.  Some servers are configured so that all CGI programs must
    have names ending in <TT>.cgi</TT>.  If this is the case on your server,
    you should specify a <TT>--cgi-suffix=.cgi</TT> option.
<P>
<DT><TT>--login=basic|form</TT>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>Type of Authentication to Use.</STRONG>
    Default= <TT>basic</TT><BR>
    Backtalk can use either of two different methods to track the identity
    of logged in users from page to page.
    <DL>
    <DT><TT>--login=basic</TT>
    <DD><EM>Basic Authentication</EM>.
        This is the authentication method built into all browsers and
	http servers.  In the case of Apache, authentication is actually
	handled by any one of several authentication modules, like
	<TT>mod_auth</TT>, <TT>mod_auth_dbm</TT>, <TT>mod_auth_db</TT>, etc.
	Users will see a pop-up box with a login form when they enter the
	system.  The browser will automatically remember their password and
	resend it as needed to access future pages.  It is not possible for
	users to log off without exiting all their browser windows.
	<P>
	The disadvantages of this are lack of control over the appearance
	of the login window, lack of a logout button, and somewhat
	promiscuous sending of the user's password, leading to increased
	vulnerability to sniffers.
    <DT><TT>--login=form</TT>
    <DD><EM>Cookie-Based Form Authentication</EM>.
	Backtalk will generate a login box on the main page.  After users
	log in, a cookie will be set containing a 'session ID'.  The browser
	will automatically send that back with all future requests.  Backtalk
	looks the session ID from the cookie up in a session database to
	identify the current users.  Users can log off by clicking a logout
	button on the screen.
	<P>
	<FONT COLOR=red><STRONG>This may be insecure on some servers!
	</STRONG></FONT>  Cookies are passed to CGI programs in environment
	variables.  On most Unix systems, it is possible to see the values
	of environment variables in other user's processes.  Thus if any
	untrusted users can login to or install CGI programs on the server
	you are using, then they could potentially steal a session ID and
	impersonate a user.
    </DL>
<P>
<DT><TT>--auth=text|db|dbm|sql|passwd|shadow</TT>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>Type of Database to Authenticate From.</STRONG>
    Default= <TT>text</TT><BR>
    Backtalk users will normally be required to give a login and password
    before accessing Backtalk.  These will be checked (by httpd) against
    some sort of database to see if they are correct.  This option
    specifies what kind of database to use.  If used with <TT>--login=basic</TT>
    your http server must have a module installed that supports this form
    of authentication database.  With <TT>--login=form</TT> no special
    support from the http server is needed and any of these options can be
    used.
    <P>
    The first four options are for Backtalk accounts, maintained by Backtalk's
    user administration tools.
    <DL>
    <DT><TT>--auth=text</TT>
    <DD>Logins and passwords are kept in a flat text file.
        This is for use with standard authentication systems like Apache's
        <TT>mod_auth</TT>.
    <DT><TT>--auth=db</TT>
    <DD>Logins and passwords are kept in a hashed Berkeley DB database.
        This is for use with Apache's <TT>mod_auth_db</TT>.
        It gives faster authentications than the <TT>text</TT> option.
        You need some version of the Berkeley DB library installed on your
        system.  Backtalk, like Apache supports versions 1, 2 and 3.
    <DT><TT>--auth=dbm</TT>
    <DD>Logins and passwords are kept in a hashed DBM database.
        This is for use with Apache's <TT>mod_auth_dbm</TT>.
        It gives faster authentications than the <TT>text</TT> option.
        You need some DBM library (Gnu's GDBM and Berkeley DB can emulate DBM)
        installed on your system.
    <DT><TT>--auth=sql</TT>
    <DD>Logins and passwords are kept in an SQL database.  You must specify
        which SQL server (ie, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc) you are using with one
	of the <TT>--with-*</TT> options below.
	There are many third-party Apache
	modules for doing basic authentication from an SQL database that
	could be used with this
	(<A HREF=http://www.giuseppetanzilli.it/mod_auth_pgsql/>mod_auth_pgsql</A>,
	<A HREF=http://authpg.sourceforge.net/>mod_auth_pg</A>,
	<A HREF=http://www.diegonet.com/support/mod_auth_mysql.shtml>mod_auth_mysql</A>,
	mod_auth_msql, mod_auth_oracle, mod_auth_ora7, mod_auth_ora8, etc.).
	However, this is most commonly used with <TT>--login=form</TT>
	instead.
    </DL>
    <P>
    The last two options are for real Unix accounts.  You'll need to use
    the standard Unix account administration tools to create and manage these
    accounts.
    <DL>
    <DT><TT>--auth=passwd</TT>
    <DD>Logins and encrypted passwords are kept in the standard Unix
        <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> file or some other database that is readable
        to all users.
        This is for Unix systems which do not have shadow password files
        (a dying breed due to their security weaknesses).
        To authenticate from such a database with Apache, you'll need to
        install <TT>mod_auth_system</TT> or <TT>mod_auth_pam</TT>.
        (<TT>Mod_auth_external</TT> could be used, but is overkill.)
    <DT><TT>--auth=shadow</TT>
    <DD>Logins and encrypted passwords are kept in the standard Unix
        <TT>/etc/shadow</TT> file or some other database that is readable
        only to root.  This includes almost all modern Unix systems.
        To authenticate from such a database with Apache, you'll need to
        install <TT>mod_auth_external</TT> and <TT>pwauth</TT>.
	(<TT>Mod_auth_system</TT> or <TT>mod_auth_pam</TT> could be used,
	but only if you weaken system security significantly.)
    </DL>
    If you implement your own authentication module, it can be selected with
    this option.  If the module is implemented in <TT>src/auth_foo.c</TT> and
    <TT>incl/auth_foo.h</TT> then it can be invoked with an <TT>--auth=foo</TT>
    option.
<P>
<DT><TT>--ident=tagfile|authfile|text|hash|sql|yapp</TT>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>Type of Database to Store User Information In.</STRONG><BR>
    Default= <TT>tagfile</TT> for Backtalk accounts,
    <TT>authfile</TT> for Unix accounts<BR>
    Backtalk needs information about each user, such as uid number,
    full name and home directory.  (Note that uid numbers and home directories
    for Backtalk accounts are completely unrelated to normal Unix uid numbers
    and directory names - they are used only internally to Backtalk.)
    There are several options for where this information is stored.
    <DL>
    <DT><TT>--ident=tagfile</TT>
    <DD>The user's home directory is generated from his login name by a
        standard algorithm.  All other user information is stored in 
	a file stored in that directory.  This option is fast and easily
	maintained, but may require more disk space than the centralized
	database options.
    <DT><TT>--ident=authfile</TT>
    <DD>All user information is stored in the same database as the
        authentication information.  This is the only option that can be
        used if you are using real Unix accounts, but it can be used with
        text or hashed databases too.  Apache will tolerate having extra
	information in the various authentication database, but this is
	not necessarily true for other HTTP servers.  Used with SQL servers,
	this puts the identity information in the same table as the password
	instead of in a separate table.
    <DT><TT>--ident=text</TT>
    <DD>User information is stored in a flat file similar in format to the
        <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> file, without the password field.  This can be
        a slow to search if you have thousands of users.
    <DT><TT>--ident=hash</TT>
    <DD>User information is stored in a hashed db or dbm file.  These can be
        searched very quickly, but can be more difficult to maintain.
    <DT><TT>--ident=sql</TT>
    <DD>User information is stored in an SQL table.  The SQL server being used
        must be specified using one of the <TT>--with-*</TT> options below.
    <DT><TT>--ident=yapp</TT>
    <DD>This is for compatibility with Yapp installations that do <EM>not</EM>
        use Unix accounts.  The user's full name and email address is stored
	in Yapp-style file called 'passwd' in their home directory.  The
	uid and gid values are stored in a file called 'id' similar to that
	used in the <TT>--ident=tagfile</TT> option.  This is clunky and the
	only reason to use it is if you are running web Yapp and Backtalk
	on the same conference database.
    </DL>
    If you implement your own identity module, it can be selected with
    this option.  If the module is implemented in <TT>src/ident_bar.c</TT> and
    <TT>incl/ident_bar.h</TT> then it can be invoked with an
    <TT>--ident=bar</TT> option.
<P>
<DT><TT>--group=text|sql|unix</TT>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>Type of Database to Store Group Information In.</STRONG><BR>
    Default= <TT>unix</TT> for Unix accounts,
    <TT>sql</TT> with SQL identity databases, <TT>text</TT> otherwise<BR>
    The group database gives the name and group id of the different user
    groups, and tells which users are in which groups.
    The default settings will almost always be right.
    <DL>
    <DT><TT>--group=unix</TT>
    <DD>Use the native Unix group database, normally the /etc/group file.
        This can only be used if <TT>--auth=passwd</TT> or
	<TT>--auth=shadow</TT> has been selected, and it is the only

    <DT><TT>--group=sql</TT>
    <DD>Use two tables in the SQL database.  An SQL server to use must
	be specified using one of the <TT>--with-*</TT> options below.
    <DT><TT>--group=text</TT>
    <DD>Use a Backtalk text file whose format is similar to the unix group
        file.  This is normally used with non-SQL Backtalk accounts.
	<P>
	If you don't want to do anything much with groups, you can select
	this option and not create the Backtalk group file.  Backtalk will
	assume the existance of three hardcoded groups:  <TT>cfadm</TT>,
	<TT>gradm</TT>, and <TT>user</TT>, with group ID numbers 0, 1, and
	2 respectively.  This will give you a tiny performance gain.
    </DL>
    If you implement your own group module, it can be selected with
    this option.  If the module is implemented in <TT>src/grp_baz.c</TT>
    then it can be invoked with an <TT>--group=baz</TT> option.
<P>

<DD><STRONG>Type of Session Database to Use.</STRONG>
    Default= <TT>none</TT> with <TT>--login=basic</TT> or <TT>text</TT> with
       <TT>--login=form</TT><BR>
    If and only if you are using form logins, then Backtalk will need to
    maintain a session database that keeps track of all currently logged in
    users.
    Two formats are supported:
    <DL>
    <DT><TT>--session=text</TT>
    <DD><EM>Binary File</EM>.
        Sessions are recorded in a binary file, normally named <EM>&lt;etcdir

    <DT><TT>--session=sql</TT>
    <DD><EM>SQL Server Table</EM>.
	Sessions are recorded in an SQL table.  An SQL server to use must
	be specified using one of the <TT>--with-*</TT> options below.
    </DL>
    If you implement your own session module, it can be selected with
    this option.  If the module is implemented in <TT>src/sess_baz.c</TT>
    then it can be invoked with an <TT>--session=bas</TT> option.
<P>
<DT><TT>--disable-edituser<BR>
--enable-edituser</TT>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>Disable User Database Editing</STRONG>
    Backtalk normally includes tools to do a variety of different kinds of
    user database editing, including creating and deleting accounts, changing
    passwords, and changing full names.
    <P>
    Obviously these are all disabled if you use Unix logins - Backtalk
    should not have access to edit the Unix /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow file.
    In such installations account maintainance is done through the usual
    Unix tools.
    <P>
    If you are using a pre-existing authentication database, and already have
    a suite of tools to maintain it, then you may not want to enable Backtalk
    to edit that database as well.  In such cases, you should configure with
    the <TT>--disable-edituser</TT> option.
<P>
<DT><TT>--disable-attachments<BR>
--enable-attachments</TT>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>Disable Attachments</STRONG>
    Backtalk normally allows users to attach images and other files to their
    postings.  These files are uploaded to the Backtalk server and
    maintained there, being kept as long as the response they are attached
    to is kept.  Allowing users to post attachments, however, can eat up a
    lot of disk space, especially since we haven't yet implemented any kind
    of quotas, so disabling this feature may be a good choice for
    installations with limited disk space.
    <P>
    If attachments are disabled, users will still be able to include links
    and images in Backtalk postings, but they will have to get those files
    onto the web via some route other than Backtalk.
    <P>
    The attachments themselves are always stored in disk files.  The attachment
    index will be stored in an SQL database if you have configured Backtalk
    with an SQL server, or in a dbm hash file otherwise.
<P>
<DT><TT>--with-pwauth=/path/to/pwauth</TT>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>Compile with the 'pwauth' authenticator</STRONG>
    Default= No<BR>
    This is only used or needed if you are doing form-based logins
    (<TT>--login=form</TT>) with real Unix accounts (<TT>--auth=shadow</TT>).
    Then Backtalk will need to know the path where
    the pwauth program is installed so that it will be able to check the
    validity of passwords.  The pwauth package is part of the
    <A HREF=http://www.unixpapa.com/mod_auth_external.html>mod_auth_external</A>
    distribution.
<P>
<DT><TT>--with-aspell</TT><BR>
<TT>--with-ispell</TT>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>Compile with the 'aspell' or 'ispell' spellchecker</STRONG>
    Default= No<BR>
    If you have Kevin Atkinson's GNU Aspell program, or Geoff Kuenning's
    International Ispell program version 3.1.x installed on your server,
    Backtalk can use it to allow users to spell check their postings.
    GNU Aspell and International Ispell are freeware and are available from
    <A HREF=http://aspell.sourceforge.net/>http://aspell.sourceforge.net/</A>
    and
    <A HREF=http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell.html>http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell.html</A> respectively.
    <P>
    If your system seems to have both, then very likely you really have only
    aspell, and the thing that appears to be ispell is aspell pretending to be
    ispell.  Aspell is probably generally to be prefered, though the foreign
    language support in ispell may (or may not) be better.
    <P>
    No other spell checkers are yet supported.
    In particular, ispell version 4.0 is a completely unrelated program, not
    a newer version of International Ispell and is not supported (and hard
    to find these days).
    <P>
    If you have and want to use <TT>aspell</TT> include the
    <TT>--with-aspell</TT> path.  If it is installed in a directory not in your
    current path, do <TT>--with-aspell=/absolute/path/to/aspell</TT>.
    Ispell can be configured similarly.
<P>
<DT><TT>--with-suexec</TT>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>Run under suExec or cgiwrap</STRONG>
    Default= No<BR>
    Many ISPs set Apache up so that all your CGI programs run as you,
    instead of as whatever user Apache runs as.  This is typically done
    with a program called <TT>suExec</TT> or <TT>cgiwrap</TT>.  If you are
    in this kind of environment, then you will need to turn on the
    <TT>with-suexec</TT> flag, and set both <TT>owner-id</TT> and
    <TT>httpd-id</TT> to your login ID.
    <P>
    <FONT COLOR=red><STRONG>Choosing this option weakens Backtalk's security.
    </STRONG></FONT>
    The file containing encrypted passwords must be readable to anyone
    who can log into any Unix account on the server.  This is because
    the authentication database must be created and edited by programs
    running as you, but they must be readable to the httpd server, which
    does not run as you.  Making it readable to the httpd server also
    makes it readable to all other users.  In some cases, you may be able
    to improve on this, but mostly doing so requires an accommodating
    administrator, and if you had one, you wouldn't be running under
    suExec, would you?
<P>
<DT><TT>--lastlog=backtalk|unix|none</TT>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>What type of Lastlog file to Maintain?</STRONG>
    Default= <TT>backtalk</TT><BR>
    The lastlog file keeps a record of when each user logged in last.
    It's useful if you want to be able to expire abandoned accounts, or just
    want to know when someone was on last.
    <DL>
    <DT><TT>--lastlog=backtalk</TT>
    <DD>Backtalk maintains it's own lastlog file.  This can be used either
        with Backtalk accounts or Unix accounts (though with Unix accounts
        it will tell only when the last logged into Backtalk, not when they
        last logged into their Unix account).
    <DT><TT>--lastlog=unix</TT>
    <DD>If you are using real Unix accounts, and your Unix system has a lastlog
        file, then you can define this to keep Backtalk's last log in the same
        file as the Unix last log.  This way, the lastlog will tell when the
        user last logged in either via Backtalk or the via the normal login
        program.
    <DT><TT>--lastlog=none</TT>
    <DD>Maintain no lastlog.
    </DL>
<P>
<DT><TT>--userlevels=0|1|2</TT>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>How many hierarchy levels to use in user directories?</STRONG>
    Default= <TT>0</TT><BR>
    If you are using Backtalk accounts, then Backtalk will maintain a
    directory for each user under the <TT>--userdir</TT> directory (see
    below).  This directory will contain his participation files and
    personal settings.  If you have a very large number of users, then
    this directory of user directories could have a lot of entries and be
    slow to find specific users in.  Increasing the number of intermediate
    directory levels improves search times.  For example, if you use 2
    levels, then the home directory for <TT>steve</TT> would be something
    like <TT>/usr/local/backtalk/user/s/t/steve</TT>.
    At most 2 intermediate levels are supported.
    <P>
    If you are using real Unix accounts, then ignore this - the user's
    normal home directory is used instead.
<P>
<DT><TT>--with-picospan<BR>
--with-yapp<BR>
--with-yapp3</TT>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>Be Picospan or Yapp Compatible?</STRONG>
    Default= neither set<BR>
    Picospan is a command-line oriented conferencing system developed by
    Marcus Watts.  It was marketed by NETI until NETI went broke.  Yapp 2.3
    is a clone of Picospan developed by Dave Thaler.  Yapp 3.0 is a web
    based version of that.  Backtalk can be
    compatible with either one, so that the same conferences can be read
    either through Backtalk or through Picospan or Yapp.  Setting these flags
    ensures that Backtalk will be strictly compatible with the named
    conferencing system.  You can't have more than one,
    as they are not completely compatible with each other.
    <P>
    Don't enable these unless you really mean to use Backtalk with Yapp or
    Picospan - the native file format is better.
    <P>
    The <TT>--with-picospan</TT> and <TT>--with-yapp</TT> options only really
    make sense with the <TT>--auth=passwd</TT> or <TT>--auth=shadow</TT>
    options and real Unix accounts.  Yapp 3.0 can be configured to use
    non-unix accounts, in which case it should be used with the
    <TT>--auth=text</TT> and <TT>--ident=yapp</TT> options.
<P>
<DT><TT>--with-pgsql<BR>
--with-mysql<BR>
--with-msql</TT>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>Use an SQL Server?</STRONG>
    Default= none<BR>
    <P>
    Options are being added to Backtalk to enable to keep some of it's
    databases, especially user databases, in an SQL database.  At this time,
    only the PostgreSQL and MySQL options have been tested.  The msql option
    is not even completely written and will not work.  We hope to add Sybase
    and Oracle options in the future.
    <P>
    <STRONG>Important Note on Configuring SQL Servers:</STRONG><BR>
    To be able to compile and link Backtalk with the header files and
    libraries for your SQL server, it may be necessary to explicitly give
    the path names where the headers and libraries reside.
    This is done by setting the <TT>CPPFLAGS</TT> and <TT>LDFLAGS</TT>
    environment variables.
    <P>
    The syntax for doing this differs in different shells.
    If you have a borne-type shell, you might do:
    <PRE>
    CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/mysql LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib/mysql \
        ./configure --with-mysql ...  </PRE>
    or if your system has the '<TT>env</TT>' program, you could do:
    <PRE>
    env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include/mysql LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib/mysql \
        ./configure --with-mysql ...  </PRE>
    The path names above are from a FreeBSD system with MySQL.
    They may be different on your system.
    <P>
    For msql installations, the path names will usually be
    <TT>/usr/local/Hughes/include</TT> and <TT>/usr/local/Hughes/lib</TT>
    respectively.
<P>
<DT><TT>--lock=fcntl|flock|lockf|tmpfile|any</TT>
<P>
<DD><STRONG>What type of Locking to Use?</STRONG>
    Default= <TT>any</TT><BR>
    Normally the configure script will choose the type of file locking to use
    on your Unix system.  If you are sharing conference files with Picospan
    or Yapp, however, then it is important that you use the same locking
    protocol as they do.  Since they can be built with different locking
    protocols, you may need to explicitly define which locking protocol to
    use.  Options are:
    <DL>
    <DT><TT>--lock=any</TT>
    <DD>Let the configure script choose a locking protocol.
    <DT><TT>--lock=fcntl</TT>
    <DD>Use the <TT>fcntl()</TT> call to lock files.
    <DT><TT>--lock=flock</TT>
    <DD>Use the <TT>flock()</TT> call to lock files.
    <DT><TT>--lock=lockf</TT>
    <DD>Use the <TT>lockf()</TT> call to lock files.
    <DT><TT>--lock=tmpfile</TT>
    <DD>Create a temp file to indicate that a file is locked.  The
        <TT>--lock=tmpfile</TT> locking protocol is compatible with
        Yapp's lock-file protocol.  It has not been tested against
        Picospan's.
    </DL>
<P>
<DT><TT>--disable-trap-crash<BR>
--enable-trap-crash</TT>
<P>
<DD>By default when Backtalk detects a software error that would cause a core
dump, it instead tries to display a detailed error page describing the error.
This is usually more useful, but if you'd like the core file instead, you
can disable this feature with this flag.  Disabling it may be a minor
security hazard on some systems where core dumps are publicly readable,
since those core dumps may contain sensitive data.
<P>
<DT><TT>--enable-exec<BR>
--disable-exec</TT>
<P>
<DD>
This option is only for use with Unix login accounts.  If enabled, it becomes
possible for users to directly execute the backtalk cgi program, and be
recognized based on their uid number.  This is mainly useful if Fronttalk
is being run on the same server as Backtalk, since it enables Fronttalk to
directly execute Backtalk instead of accessing it though the http server,
thus eliminating the need for users already logged into the system to relogin
to run Backtalk.
<P>
<DT><TT>--disable-dynaload<BR>
--enable-dynaload</TT>
<P>
<DD>This option is now mostly useless, as only very small parts of the program
are dynamically loaded even if it is enabled.  It may not compile successfully
on some versions of Unix.
<P>
Everytime you click a link or button while using Backtalk, the Backtalk
program must be loaded and run from scratch (this is a problem common to
almost all CGI programs).  This means that loading fast is more important
for Backtalk than for many other programs.  If Backtalk is configured with
the <TT>--enable-dynaload</TT> directive, then some of the less commonly
used parts of the program will be built as shared libraries, and only linked
in on-demand only if they are needed.  This makes the program a bit smaller
and a bit faster to load.

<H3>Low-Level Configuration Options</H3>

Not all Backtalk configuration options are settable from the
"<TT>./configure</TT>" utility.  For unusual configurations, you may want
to set some lower-level options by manually editting the
<TT>incl/config.h</TT> or <TT>incl/common.h</TT> files.
Since <TT>incl/config.h</TT> is overwritten every time you run
"<TT>./configure</TT>" this isn't really a great place to put local
customizations.  So "<TT>incl/config.h</TT>" includes
"<TT>incl/localconfig.h</TT>", which exists solely as a from which to alter
low-level settings.
<P>
These instructions will not give extensive details on the different low-level
options.  Lots of comments exist in the <TT>incl/config.h</TT> file, and most
sites will never need any of these.  We will list a few so you know they
exist.  Several of these may need to be changed when integrating with a
<A HREF=auth.html>foreign authentication</A> system.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><TT>MAX_LOGIN_LEN</TT>
<DD>Defines the number maximum number of characters allowed in a user login
name.
<DT><TT>AUTH_FILE</TT>
<DD>Defines the location of a flat <TT>mod_auth</TT>-style
<TT>htpasswd</TT> file.
<DT><TT>AUTH_DBM</TT>
<DD>Defines the location of a hash <TT>mod_auth_db</TT> or
<TT>mod_auth_dbm</TT>-style password file.
<DT><TT>AUTO_CREATE_DIR</TT>
<DD>If defined, Backtalk will create a home directory for any user who hasn't
got one.  If accounts were created by another program, then home directories
are likely missing.
<DT><TT>SESSION_COOKIE</TT>
<DD>Defines the name of the cookie that contains the session ID.
<DT><TT>SESSION_ID_LEN</TT>
<DD>Maximum size of a session ID.  Defined in <TT>incl/sess.h</TT>.
Changing this won't make Backtalk make larger session IDs, but if you are
using session IDs generated by a different program, it will make Backtalk
able to read them.
