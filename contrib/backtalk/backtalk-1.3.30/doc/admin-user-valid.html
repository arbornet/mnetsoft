<P>
If your Backtalk system is set up so that users use use real Unix login ids
to log into Backtalk, then you won't be able to validate or invalidate users
through Backtalk.  All user administration must be done through the standard
Unix commands instead.
<P>
However, if you system is set up to only use Backtalk accounts, then
system administrators can validate or invalidate users.
A user who is invalidated or unvalidated cannot log in.
The system will reject any password he types in.
<P>
Some systems create all accounts in an unvalidated state and require a
system administrator to validate each user before they can log in.
The procedure for validating or invalidating a user follows.
(The checkboxes below perform no function -
they are just for your convenience.)
