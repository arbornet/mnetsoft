Obviously, this step should be skipped if you haven't configured
Backtalk to use an SQL server.  Proceed directly to the installation
step.
<P>
<STRONG>(1) Create the SQL Database</STRONG>
<P>
If you are not using a pre-existing database, then this is the time to create
one.  The normal name for the database would be '<TT>backtalk</TT>' but
anything can be used.  The database must be accessible from whatever account
the CGI's run on.
<P>
The commands to create a database will vary for different SQL servers.
For PostgreSQL, you might create a database with:
<PRE>
    createdb backtalk</PRE>
<P>
You might also want to create a username and password for Backtalk to log
in as and permit the database to be accessible only to that account.  Whether
this is needed depends on your configuration.
<P>
<STRONG>(2) Edit the Runtime Configuration File</STRONG>
<P>
Edit <TT>misc/backtalk.conf</TT>.
<P>
If you are upgrading a system that uses SQL, you will probably want to
copy the `<TT>backtalk.conf</TT>' file that is installed in the backtalk
<TT>etc</TT> directory into <TT>misc/backtalk.conf</TT>.
<P>
Currently the only things that can be set in this file are SQL server
configuration settings.  If your SQL server is running on the same machine
as Backtalk, the database is called '<TT>backtalk</TT>', and no login or
password is needed to connect, you can probably use he default configuration
file without changes.  Otherwise, you may want to set the following options:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> <STRONG>SQL Server Hostname</STRONG>.<BR>
     This is the name of the machine that the SQL server runs on.  The
     syntax is like
     <BR>&nbsp;<BR><TT>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sql_hostname sqlserver.mysite.com</TT>
     <BR>&nbsp;<BR>
     The default is '<TT>localhost</TT>', that is the same machine that
     Backtalk runs on.
     <BR>&nbsp;<BR>
     If the name '<TT>localhost</TT>' is given, Backtalk will usually
     not form a TCP/IP connection, but will instead use the more efficient
     Unix sockets.  If you give a fully qualified domain name, like
     '<TT>sqlserver.mysite.com</TT>', then a TCP/IP connection will be
     made, even if that happens to be the same machine Backtalk is
     running on.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<LI> <STRONG>SQL Server Port Number</STRONG>.<BR>
     This is the port number that the SQL server listens for connections on.
     The command to set this looks like:
     <BR>&nbsp;<BR><TT>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sql_port 5432</TT>
     <BR>&nbsp;<BR>
     The default depends on the SQL server you are using.  Unless your SQL
     server has been modified to listen on something other than the default
     port, you shouldn't have to set this.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<LI> <STRONG>SQL Database Name</STRONG>.<BR>
     This is the name of the database that you created in step (1).
     The default is '<TT>backtalk</TT>'.  You can set something else
     with a command like:
     <BR>&nbsp;<BR><TT>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sql_dbname my_conf_db</TT>
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<LI> <STRONG>SQL Login Name</STRONG>.<BR>
     If a login is needed to access the database, then the login name should
     be specified, as follows:
     <BR>&nbsp;<BR><TT>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sql_login conflogin
     </TT><BR>&nbsp;<BR>
     If no login name is configured, none is used.
<BR>&nbsp;<BR>
<LI> <STRONG>SQL Login Password</STRONG>.<BR>
     If a password is needed to access the database, then the password name
     should be specified, as follows:
     <BR>&nbsp;<BR><TT>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sql_password foobar</TT>
     <BR>&nbsp;<BR>
     If no password is configured, none is used.
     <BR>&nbsp;<BR>
     Note that the password must be given in clear text, and the configuration
     file must be readable to the backtalk owner account.  There may be
     security issues with this on some servers.
</OL>
