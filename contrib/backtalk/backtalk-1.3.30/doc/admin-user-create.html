If your Backtalk system is set up so that users use real Unix login ids
to log into Backtalk, then you won't be able to create accounts with
Backtalk.  You should use the Unix commands instead.
<P>
However, if you system is set up to only use Backtalk accounts,
then accounts can be created either through the administrative web interface
or through the Unix "<TT>btmkuser</TT>" command.
Just follow the following steps.
(The checkboxes below perform no function -
they are just for your convenience.)

<H2>Creating Accounts by using the Web Interface</H2>

Backtalk can be installed in any of three configurations:
<UL>
<LI> So anyone can fill out a form and immediately create themselves a
     usable account.
<LI> So anyone can fill out a form and create an account, but the accounts
     are not usable until an conference adminstrator has
     <A HREF=admin-user-valid.html>validated</A> them.
<LI> So only conference administrators and users in the 'gradm' group
     can create accounts.
</UL>
So there are two different web-based account creation forms.  The public
user registration form will work only on systems configured in one of the
first two ways described above.
The "Create User Account" link on the Backtalk administrative menu leads
to a similar form (though it has a few more options) which works on all
installations.
<P>
Creating accounts with the public newuser page shouldn't require any
explanation here (it is, after all, desgined to be usable by any random
person who wanders in off the web).
The administrative page is hardly more complex, but we'll go through it
step by step anyway.
(The checkboxes below perform no function -
they are just for your convenience.)
<FORM>
<OL>
<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Log into the administration account
<P>
See the <A HREF=admin-menu.html>logging in instructions</A>.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Goto the user creation page.
<P>
There is a link on the administration page labelled "Create User Account".
Click on this.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Fill out the form.
<P>
The account creation form has two sections.  The first part asks for
information that Backtalk needs to make a working account.  The second
asks various other random information that system administators like to
collect (you can configure what is asked for here by editing the
<TT>lib/userinfo.bt</TT> script, as described in the installation manual).
<P>
The only non-obvious part of this is the selection of groups.  As in unix,
each account is associated with one primary group, and zero or more other
groups.  For users in more than one group, it mostly doesn't matter which
is entered as the 'primary group' and which are entered as 'other groups'.
<P>
Two groups are special.  The 'cfadm' group is the administrative group.
Any login in that group will be able to create, edit, and destroy conferences
and user accounts.  Obviously only very trusted users should be given access
to accounts in the cfadm group.
<P>
Users in the 'gradm' group function as "group leaders" for any other groups
they are in.  They can create and configure accounts in those groups,
<P>
The 'user' group is the default group for all ordinary users.

<HR>
</FORM>
</OL>

<H2>Creating Accounts by using <TT>btmkuser</TT> command from Unix</H2>

The <TT>btmkuser</TT> command can only be used from
the conference adminstrator account, not by random other people.
It creates minimal accounts, with only the login name, password and fullname
set, not with all the other stuff like gender and email addresses.
It's meant mainly as an aid to people who have to create accounts in large
batches and want to write shell scripts to do so.
Maybe we'll add more features if there is a demand.

<FORM>
<OL>
<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Log into the Unix conference administration account
<P>
This is the account that owns all the conference files, user database
files, and Backtalk itself.

<HR>

<LI><INPUT TYPE=checkbox> Run the <TT>btmkuser</TT> command

<P>
You can create an account interactively by just running:
<PRE>
    btmkuser
</PRE>
It will ask you for the account name, the user's full name, and the 
initial password (twice).
<P>
You can also specify some or all of this information on the command line:
<PRE>
    btmkuser -l eve -n "Eve, Daughter of God" -p "OmiGosh!"
</PRE>
The <TT>-l</TT>, <TT>-n</TT> and <TT>-p</TT> options allow you to specify the
login, fullname and password on the command line.
If you omit any of these, you will be asked for them.
Not that full names and passwords are generally likely to contain spaces
and weird characters, and should generally be quoted.
<P>
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> Specifying the password on the command line is
potentially a bad idea.
If there are other users on your system who can do a "<TT>ps</TT>" command,
they will be able to see the commands you are running, with their arguments.
Thus they can see the login name and password of the account you are
creating.
If you have untrustworthy users on your system, we recommend not using the
"-p" option.
<P>
In addition, it is possible to specify the user's primary group on the
<TT>btmkuser</TT> command with a -g option, like
<PRE>
    btmkuser -l adam -g humans -n "Adam, Son of God" -p "GeeWhiz!"
</PRE>
Other groups can be set by editing the Backtalk group file.
