<HR>
If you are installing a system using Unix accounts,
read the <A HREF=install5b.html>other version</A> of this page.
<P>
You may need to make some adjustments to the configuration of your
http server before Backtalk will work properly.
Backtalk can be used with any http server, but configuration instructions
are given here for Apache only.  Sorry, we don't know an awful lot about
the others.
<P>
<STRONG>(1) Install Needed Modules</STRONG>
<P>
If you selected the default <TT>--authtype=text</TT> option, then
this should be an issue.  It is possible to build Apache without
<TT>mod_auth</TT> installed, but would be really unusual.
<P>
If you selected <TT>--authtype=db</TT> or <TT>--authtype=dbm</TT> then
you need to be sure your Apache server has <TT>mod_auth_db</TT> or
<TT>mod_auth_dbm</TT> (respectively) installed.
These are not installed by default
in the standard Apache distribution.
Redhat 6.1 installs only <TT>mod_auth_db</TT>.
<P>
To check, find your httpd program and run it with an <TT>-l</TT> option
on the command line.  This will list the modules linked into it.  If
the module you need is listed, then you are all set.  If not, check
if <TT>mod_so.c</TT> is on the list.  If it is, then your Apache server
is set up to dynamically load additional modules, and you should check if
the module you need is installed as a dynamically loaded module.
Dynamically loaded modules are normally found in the `<TT>modules</TT>'
directory under Apache's home directory (possibly
`<TT>/usr/local/apache/modules</TT>' or
`<TT>/etc/httpd/modules</TT>').  Look in this directory to see if the
module you need is installed.
<P>
If it is not installed, then you'll need to install it.
To do this, follow the instructions in the Apache distribution.
Note that if you have a server configured for dynamically loaded modules,
installing new ones is pretty easy using the `<TT>apxs</TT>' command.
Otherwise, you'll have to recompile Apache with the new module
(which is not really all that hard either).
<P>
<STRONG>(2) Enable Authentication</STRONG>
<P>
The Backtalk installation scripts will have created two subdirectories
under your CGI directory, one named `<TT>pw</TT>' the other named
`<TT>adm</TT>'.  Into these directories it has placed some programs
that should only be runnable by authenticated users, and it has placed
some files named `<TT>.htaccess</TT>' which configure the authentication
for those directories.
<P>
As usually distributed, Apache will ignore the `<TT>.htaccess</TT>' files.
To enable them, we need to make a slight change in the configuration.
<P>
To do this, locate the `<TT>httpd.conf</TT>' configuration file for
Apache and edit it.
Find the section of the configuration file that configures the
options on the cgi-bin directory.  It probably looks something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
    &lt;Directory "/home/httpd/cgi-bin"&gt;
        AllowOverride None
        Options ExecCGI
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    &lt;/Directory&gt;</PRE>
Change the `<TT>AllowOverride</TT>' line to say
<P>
<PRE>
        AllowOverride AuthConfig</PRE>
This says that `<TT>.htaccess</TT>' files may override the authentication
configuration settings for this directory and its subdirectories.
<P>
An alternative to using the `<TT>.htaccess</TT>' files would be to
add into `<TT>httpd.conf</TT>' some new directory configuration blocks 
similar to the one above but for the `<TT>pw</TT>' and `<TT>adm</TT>'
subdirectories.  The commands in the `<TT>.htaccess</TT>' files would be
put into these blocks instead.
<P>
<STRONG>(3) Restart Apache</STRONG>
<P>
Tell the currently running apache to reload its configuration file,
so the new settings are activated.  If your system has the `<TT>apachectl</TT>'
program installed, do:
<P>
<PRE>
        apachectl restart</PRE>
For Redhat 6.1, which doesn't have `<TT>apachectl</TT>', do instead:
<P>
<PRE>
        /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>(4) Test Authentication</STRONG>
<P>
If you aren't confident that you have Apache and the Backtalk authentication
system all correctly installed, then you may want to run some tests by using
your browser to run Backtalk's little cgitest script.
<P>
The URLs of the cgitest program will be
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>cgiurl</EM><TT>/cgitest</TT><EM>cgisuffix</EM><TT>/foo?bar</TT><BR>
<EM>cgiurl</EM><TT>/pw/cgitest</TT><EM>cgisuffix</EM><TT>/foo?bar</TT><BR>
<EM>cgiurl</EM><TT>/adm/cgitest</TT><EM>cgisuffix</EM><TT>/foo?bar</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
For example, if you configured <TT>cgiurl</TT> to
<TT>http://your.host.name/cgi-bin/backtalk</TT> and did not set
<TT>cgisuffix</TT>,
then the URLs would be
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>http://your.host.name/cgi-bin/backtalk/cgitest/foo?bar</TT><BR>
<TT>http://your.host.name/cgi-bin/backtalk/pw/cgitest/foo?bar</TT><BR>
<TT>http://your.host.name/cgi-bin/backtalk/adm/cgitest/foo?bar</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Try hitting these URLs with your browser.
<P>
The first URL is just to test that you can run CGI scripts and that your
http server is vaguely sane.
The output will look something like:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
environment variables:<BR>
HTTP_USER_AGENT=Mozilla/4.61 [en] (X11; I; Linux 2.2.12-20 i686)
<BR>
PATH_INFO=/foo
<BR>
PATH_TRANSLATED=/home/httpd/html/foo
<BR>
QUERY_STRING=bar
<BR>
REMOTE_ADDR=209.142.241.230
<BR>
REMOTE_HOST=undefined
<BR>
REMOTE_USER=undefined
<BR>
SCRIPT_NAME=/cgi-bin/backtalk/cgitest
<HR>
httpd id:<BR>
uid=99(nobody) gid=99(nobody) groups=99(nobody)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
If you instead only get an error message or no output at all, something is
definitely wrong.  The error messages displayed by the browser are often
vague.  Check the http server's error log for a more detailed message.
If the <TT>cgitest</TT> program was not found, the log file will get the
path name it looked at.  Is the <TT>cgitest</TT> program there and correctly
permitted?  If it is looking under the document root, you may need to add
a <TT>ScriptAlias</TT> for the `<TT>cgi-bin</TT>' directory (for Apache, this
should be in the <TT>httpd.conf</TT> file.
<P>
If you are seeing the contents of the <TT>cgitest</TT> program instead of its
output, then Apache is not recognizing it as a CGI program and is just
displaying the file instead of running it.  Your server may be configured to
require a <TT>.cgi</TT> suffix on CGI program files.
<P>
If it runs, you should confirm that
<UL>
<LI>HTTP_USER_AGENT is a string describing your browser.
<LI>PATH_INFO is ``/foo'' (as given in the URL above).
<LI>PATH_TRANSLATED is the full path to your document root followed by ``/foo''.
<LI>QUERY_STRING is ``bar'' (as given in the URL above).
<LI>REMOTE_ADDR is the IP number of the host your browser is running on.
<LI>REMOTE_HOST is undefined or the name of the host your browser is running on
(whether or not it is defined depends on you server's configuration and doesn't
particularly matter to Backtalk).
<LI>REMOTE_USER is undefined.
<LI>SCRIPT_NAME is ``/cgi-bin/backtalk/cgitest''
(or whatever else was between the hostname and the
``/foo'' in the URL you used).
<LI>The http id is the one you defined in the <TT>httpd-id</TT> configuration
setting.
</UL>
<P>
The second two URLs run the same test script, but authentication should be
required for them.  Your browser should pop up a login window, and
the login ID 'cfadm' and the password you set during installation give
you output similar to that shown above, except that <TT>REMOTE_USER</TT>
should be 'cfadm'.
<P>
If you are not asked for authentication and <TT>REMOTE_USER</TT> is shown
as undefined, then Apache is not recognizing the <TT>.htaccess</TT> file.
Check that you have `<TT>AllowOverride AuthConfig</TT>' set for the
<TT>cgi-bin</TT> directory.
<P>
Note that once you have authenticating, if you run the same program again,
or another program in the same directory, you will not be asked to log in
again.  Your browser remembers your old authentication and automatically
resends it.  To log in as a different user, you need to exit and restart
the browser.
This is, in fact, the sole purpose of the `adm' subdirectory.
With two links to Backtalk in directories with different AuthNames,
it is possible for a person to be logged on simultaneously as two
different users. This is especially useful for conference administrators,
who may want to access the administration account without exiting their
personal accounts. That's why the second directory is called `adm',
though the link to Backtalk in there does not actually have any
special properties.
