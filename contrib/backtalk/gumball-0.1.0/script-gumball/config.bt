% Backtalk Gumball Interface -- (c) 1996, Jan Wolter, Steve Weiss
%
% config script
%
% NOTE:  This is only the configuration file for the Gumball Interface.
% The configuration file for backtalk as a whole has the same name but is in
% the top level script directory.
%
% This is identical to the Bubblegum configuration file.  Having a separate
% copy means that Gumball can be configured separate from Bubblegum.

% Default background colors for Gumball:
/bg_color (FFFF99) defconstant
/text_bg  (FFFFCC) defconstant
/background `( BGCOLOR=")bg_color(" )' defconstant

% Button Set:
%   button_url is the URL of the image directory to use for bubblegum images.
%      It ends with a backslash.
%   button_h and button_w are the standard sizes of those buttons.
%   button_sep is the number of pixels between vertically stacked buttons.

/button_url `imghost(/bubblegum/gumball/)' defconstant
/button_h 72 defconstant
/button_w 100 defconstant
/button_sep 3 defconstant

%/button_url `imghost(/bubblegum/book/)' defconstant
%/button_h 72 defconstant

%/button_sep 8 defconstant

% Global page header:
%   This macro is executed at the top of every Gumball page.  By default, it
%   does nothing.  It's a sensible place to put ads (yuck).  If you define it,
%   set /global_header_height to the approximate height in pixels of your
%   global header.  This is used to enlarge the frame on the top of the page
%   enough to hold the header.
%
%   For example, a typical ad rotator might be done like this:
%   /global_header {
%     (<A HREF="http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/www.hsx.com/;sz=468x60;ord=x">
%     <IMG SRC="http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/www.hsx.com/;sz=468x60;ord=x"
%     WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="60" BORDER=0></A><P>\n)
%   } defconstant
%   /global_header_height 72 defconstant

/global_header {
} def
/global_header_height 0 defconstant

% Global page footer:
%   This macro is executed at the bottom of every Gumball page.  It normally
%   generates some HTML footer text.   The default is a Backtalk copyright
%   message, but you are welcome to take that out if you want to put something
%   else here, say, links to other parts of your web site.

/global_footer {
  (<P><TD><FONT SIZE=-2>- )version

} def

% Booktalk Customizations
%   The Canton Public Library Booktalk system makes a few non-standard
%   customizations to the bubblegum interface.
%
% booktalk_cflist
%   In booktalk, users normally don't have their own .cflist files, and
%   instead use a somewhat rigidly structured dflt.cflist with two tags
%   in it (endclass and endpublic) that are treated specially.  This is
%   enabled by defining booktalk_cflist as 1.
%
% booktalk_buttons
%   Booktalk deletes the 'read new' button from begin, and the 'next forum'
%   button from the confhome page.  Defining booktalk_buttons as 1 does this.
%
% booktalk_nolink
%   Booktalk deletes the 'link' button that normally allows fairwitnesses
%   to share items with other conferences.  Defining booktalk_nolink as 1
%   does this.
%
% booktalk_teachtools
%   The booktalk administrative tool set includes a page for teachers to
%   administer student accounts.  If booktalk_teachtools is 1, then teachers
%   will see a link to their admin page on their conference home page.

% Names for Things:
%   Backtalk by default uses some slightly odd names for things.  Most of these
%   are inherited from Picospan.  The following definitions let you rename
%   them.  You might prefer 'host' to 'fairwitness', or 'topic' to 'item', or
%   or 'forum' to 'conference'.  Note that this doesn't redefine the words
%   that appear on the buttons.  You'll have to edit the buttons the hard way.
%   Note that the defined values should be all lower case.
