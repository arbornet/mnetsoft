% Backtalk Wasabi Interface -- (c) 2004, Jan Wolter
%
% peekconf script
%
% This is the entry point when we do peek:<conf>.  The conference name is
% passed in in the "conf" variable.  Unlike other interfaces, the wasabi
% front page displays an item from the conference.  You could make this link
% to the table of contents page instead, but that is not really wasabi-like.
% The wasabi concept definately include content on the front page.
